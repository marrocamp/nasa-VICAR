VIDS command JDROP
.help
The JDROP command is used to make a display device unavailable to VIDS.
After calling JDROP, the named device cannot be used by VIDS without
calling JGRAB on it again.

You should deallocate the device with the FREE command after dropping it,
in order to free up the device for other users.  JDROP will not deallocate
the device.

Note that the current device is undefined after calling JDROP, so you should
put a "DEVICE=" parameter on your next command, or call JGRAB to set up
a new current device.

The special device name "all" can be used to drop all the active devices.
This is normally used only when terminating VIDS.

See also the JGRAB command, which is the opposite of JDROP.

Examples:

USE EPA1		- allocate EPA1.
VIDS			- no JGRAB need be performed.
jdisp xxx		- displays on EPA1.
USE EPA2		- allocate EPA2, but not available to VIDS yet.
JGRAB EPA2		- device EPA2 is now available, as well as EPA1.
jdisp xxx		- displays on EPA2.
JGRAB EPA1		- device EPA1 is now current.
jdisp xxx		- displays on EPA1.
jdisp xxx DEVICE=EPA2	- displays on EPA2.
JDROP EPA2		- EPA2 is no longer available.  EPA1 still is.
FREE EPA2		- deallocates EPA2 so other users can have it.
jdisp xxx DEVICE=EPA1	- displays on EPA1.

Physical device name
of display device to drop
.level2
.var device
DEVICE specifies the physical device name of a display device to drop.
Use the JSHOW-DEVICE command to see what devices you have currently
grabbed.

If you don't give the DEVICE parameter, the currently active display
device will be dropped.

The special device name "all" can be used to drop all the active devices.
This is normally used only when terminating VIDS.
