VIDS Command JTEXT
.help
The JTEXT command is used to draw text and other symbols in the
graphics plane.  The location for the text may be defined either
interactively with the cursor, or via the command line.

Text attributes, such as font, size, and rotation, are set with
the JSET-TEXT command.  The color used to draw the text is set with
the JSET-COLOR command (the same color is used with graphics and JDRAW).

The string to print is given with the TEXT parameter.  Some fonts
have special symbols that are not in the ASCII character set.  To
access those, use a backslash (\) followed by the number of the
character, for example "Symbol: \24".  See the help for the TEXT
parameter for more details.
.page
The location to print the text is given either via the LOCATION
parameter, or by the cursor if LOCATION is not given, in which case
a box will follow the cursor around indicating the size and angle
of the text.  The ORIENT keyword parameter selects whether the point
is on the left, the center, or the right side of the text baseline.

It is important to note that anything drawn in the graphics plane,
including text, will totally obscure the image pixels underneath.  There
is no way to blend the image with the graphics.  You may see the obscured
parts of the image by turning the graphics plane off (JOFF GRAPHICS) or
by drawing over parts of the image with the special graphics color
TRANSPARENT (set with JSET-COLOR), which erases the graphics.

Examples:

JTEXT "Hello, World" (100,150)	- Prints the string at the given location
JTEXT "Howdy, Pardner!"		- Prints at interactively defined location
JTEXT "Right on" 'RIGHT		- Selected point is the right side of the text

.vari text
The TEXT parameter specifies the text string to print.  Different fonts
have different characters available to print.  Some may have upper case
only, some have upper and lower but no special characters, etc.  If you
give characters in TEXT that don't exist in the current font, an error
message is printed by the VRDI for that character, but the rest of the
string is still printed.

Some fonts have special symbols in addition to or instead of the standard
alphabet.  These symbols are defined by their character number, which can
range from 0 to 127.  Since there is not always an ASCII character
corresponding to the number, there is a way to give the number directly.
.page
A backslash (\) character in the string followed by some numbers will
indicate that the given character number is to be used.  For example,
to print symbol number 15, you would specify "\15".  This can be mixed
freely with text (assuming the font has both available), for example
"Symbol \10 is a strange one".  If you want a backslash in the text,
just put two in a row, like this: "A backslash looks like: \\".

At most three digits are used after the backslash, so if you want a
special symbol followed by a number, you can do it.  For example,
character 23 followed by a 5 would look like "\0235".

The special symbols for various fonts are listed in the appendices to the
VRDI User's Reference Guide.
.page
As an example, take the Cartographic Special Characters font, number 102
(you may want to refer to the VRDI User's Reference Guide for this).
We want to print an arrow, followed by the number 42, followed by an
exclamation point.  According to the table, the arrow is character 32.
Note that the numerals are in character values 0-9.  This means that you
cannot just put the numbers in the string, as the ASCII values for the
numerals are 48-57, not 0-9.  So, for the string "42" you must use
character 4 and character 2.  Finally, the exclamation is character 13.
So, your string would look like:

        "\32\4\2\13"
.vari location
The LOCATION parameter specifies the point at which to place the text.
It is a pair of integers of the form (line,sample).  The coordinates
are always relative to the graphics plane.

If you do not give LOCATION, then the location will be defined
interactively using the cursor.  A box will follow the cursor around
on the display device, indicating the size and angle of the text.
You will be prompted with instructions.
.vari orient
The ORIENT keyword parameter selects whether the string is left, center,
or right justified.  With 'LEFT (the default), the point you select is
the bottom left corner of the text.  With 'CENTER, the point you select
is the bottom center of the text.  If you specify 'RIGHT, the point you
select is the bottom right corner of the text.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
