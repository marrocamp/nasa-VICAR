VIDS command JOFF

Planes to turn off
.vari device
Name of device to use
.level2
The JOFF command will turn off all of the output lookup tables associated
with each plane listed.  Any plane name may be specified; note, however,
that if the device is in black and white mode, the planes RED, GREEN, or
BLUE may not produce the desired effect.

The lookup tables may be restored to their previous state by using the
JON command to turn them on.

Examples:
	JOFF			! turn off all visible planes
	JON			! turn them back on.
	JOFF GRAPHICS		! turn off the graphics plane
	JOFF RED		! turn off the red plane.
	JOFF (GREEN,BLUE)	! turn off the green and blue planes
.vari planes
PLANES is used to specify which planes to turn off.  All lookup tables
associated with that plane are turned off.  They may be restored with
the JON command.

PLANES may take any valid plane name, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE, COLOR,
GRAPHICS, or VISIBLE.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
