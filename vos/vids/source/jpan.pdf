VIDS command JPAN
.help
The JPAN command will "pan" the image memory planes so that a
different window is visible on the screen.  Its primary use is
to move around an image plane which is larger than what is 
visible on the screen, or which has been zoomed to be larger
than what is visible.

If the LOCATION parameter is given, the image planes (or image
files, if 'FILE is given) will be panned to that location.  If
LOCATION is not given, the trackball (or other interactive device)
may be used to move the image planes interactively.

The SOURCE parameter determines whether the source of data for 
the pan will be only the display device, or whether data which
has not been loaded into image memory planes will be "paged" 
into memory as the image is panned through, thus allowing the
user to pan through a large image file, and not be restricted 
to the size of the display device memory planes.  Note that
if the SOURCE is the file, the panning will be much slower.

When panning interactively, the pan may be terminated with 
trackball button 1 (or a carriage return, or the letter 'A'),
saving the pan.  If you do not wish to save the pan (i.e., you
want the device to reset to where it was before the pan), push
button 2 (or 'C' on the keyboard) to cancel.

See examples on the next page.

.vari planes
Image planes to pan
.vari location
Location to move planes to.

FILE to pan through disk file

.vari planes
The PLANES parameter is used to specify individual planes to be
panned.  It is the standard VIDS plane parameter, which can be 
either a name of a plane (such as RED, GREEN, COLOR, etc.) or an
actual plane number (1,2,3...).  See HELP PLANENAMES for detail.

Many devices will not allow image planes to be panned independently
of one another.  In this case, VIDS will inform you that all planes
must be panned together and will pan all planes.  If you do not wish
to pan all planes, the CANCEL button (button 2 on the trackball or a
'C' on the terminal keyboard) will restore the device to the state
before you issued the JPAN command.  To save the pan, stop it with
the ACCEPT button (button 1 on the trackbal or the letter 'A' or a
carriage return).
.vari location
LOCATION is used to specify a location on the image plane which will
be moved to the upper left corner of the monitor, or, if SOURCE=FILE,
a location in the image file to be moved to the upper left corner.
It is of the form LOCATION=(line,samp), where line and samp are the
location in the image plane(s) or file(s) to be moved to the upper left
of the monitor.

If the LOCATION parameter is specified, the planes are moved and control
is immediately returned to the user; no interactive panning is performed.
If you wish to use the trackball to pan interactively, do not specify
LOCATION.

For example, if you have 2048x2048 image memory planes and a 1024x1024
video output, LOCATION=(1025,1025) would allow you to view the lower
right quadrant of your planes.
.vari source
SOURCE indicates the source of the image data.  If SOURCE=DISPLAY, then
the pan is performed only using the image display hardware.  If 
SOURCE=FILE, then image data from the image file(s) displayed will
be put on the display device as neccessary to fill in missing data
and allow a large file to panned through interactively without issueing
successive JDISP or JLOAD-IMAGE commands.

If SOURCE=FILE, panning may be exceedingly slow, so it may often be 
preferable to reload a portion of the image file manually and pan
locally on the display device (SOURCE=DISPLAY).

The default is DISPLAY.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
