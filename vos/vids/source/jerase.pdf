VIDS command JERASE
.help
The JERASE command will erase image planes and/or regions on image
planes for the current display device. It takes an optional list of
planes to erase, as well as a list of regions.  The default is to
erase all visible image planes in their entirety.

Examples:

JERASE COLOR	- Erase the red, green, and blue planes
JERASE 1 FOO	- Erase the contents of plane 1 under the region FOO
JERASE ALL	- Erase all image planes

The PLANES parameter is a string parameter which can contain a list
of planes to erase.  It is the standard VIDS PLANES parameter, and
may either be the names of image planes, or a list of numbers.

Note that the BW plane will often correspond to one of the color
planes as well, so that if you are in color mode, "JERASE BW" may
result in the erasure of one of the visible planes, and vice versa.

See HELP PLANENAMES for more detail.

Examples:

JERASE (R,G,BLUE)	- Erase the red, green, and blue planes
JERASE (3,4)		- Erase planes 3 and 4
JERASE GRAPHICS		- Erase the graphics plane
JERASE (GRE,GRA)	- Erase the green plane and the graphics plane
.vari regions
The REGIONS parameter is an optional list of regions to erase.  Only
the area contained within these regions will be cleared, on each of
the planes listed with PLANES.  Regions may be defined with the
JDEF-REGION command.  Any shaped region may be erased.

Example:

JDEF-REGION FOO POINTS=(100,100,300,300)
JERASE RED FOO

These commands will erase the 201 x 201 pixel area from (line,samp)=(100,100)
to (line,samp)=(300,300) on the red plane.  
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
