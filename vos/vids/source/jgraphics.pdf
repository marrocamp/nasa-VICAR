VIDS command JGRAPHICS
.help
The JGRAPHICS command is used to switch which plane is to be used 
for graphics overlay.  Some devices do not allow the graphics plane
to be switched; in this case, an error message will be issued and
the plane will not be switched.

This command also turns the graphics plane on (see also: JON).

NOTE:  Using the same image plane for graphics overlay and display
of image data may give unpredictable results, such as mis-registration
of image planes.

See the example on the next page.

Example:

JCOLOR (1,2,4)
JGRAPHICS 3

These commands will cause (r,g,b) color images to be displayed from
planes 1, 2, and 4 respectively, and image plane 3 to be used for 
graphics overlay.

.vari plane
Image plane to be used
for graphics overlay.
.vari device
Name of device to use
.level2
.vari plane
The PLANE parameter indicates which image memory plane should be used
for graphics overlay.  It is the standard VIDS PLANE parameter, and
thus may be specified as an integer or as an existing name.  See 
HELP PLANENAMES for details on specifying image plane names.

If the plane is already being used for display of image data, the
results of the JGRAPHICS command are unpredictable.  Be careful not
to use the same plane for both images and graphics.

Example:

JCOLOR (1,2,4)
JGRAPHICS 3

These commands will cause (r,g,b) color images to be displayed from
planes 1, 2, and 4 respectively, and image plane 3 to be used for 
graphics overlay.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
