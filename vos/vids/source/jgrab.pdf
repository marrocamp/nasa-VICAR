VIDS command JGRAB
.help
The JGRAB command is used to make a display device available to
VIDS after it has been allocated, and to make it the current
display device.

The device should be allocated with the USE command before calling JGRAB.
JGRAB must be called in order for VIDS to know about the device.  Pre-allocating
the device is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea because other
applications won't be able to use the device if you don't allocate it.

If the device has already been grabbed, then executing JGRAB on that
device again merely sets it as the current display device.  You can also
change the current device by putting a "DEVICE=" parameter on any VIDS
command.  However, the first time you use a device you must use JGRAB.
.page
Note that VIDS automatically calls JGRAB on startup, so if you allocate
a device before entering VIDS, it will be grabbed for you.  Any additional
devices, however, must be explicitly grabbed with JGRAB.

See also the JDROP command, which is the opposite of JGRAB.

Examples:

USE EPA1		- allocate EPA1.
VIDS			- no JGRAB need be performed.
jdisp xxx		- displays on EPA1.
USE EPA2		- allocate EPA2, but not available to VIDS yet.
JGRAB EPA2		- device EPA2 is now available, as well as EPA1.
jdisp xxx		- displays on EPA2.
JGRAB EPA1		- device EPA1 is now current.
jdisp xxx		- displays on EPA1.
jdisp xxx DEVICE=EPA2	- displays on EPA2.
JDROP EPA2		- EPA2 is no longer available.  EPA1 still is.
FREE EPA2		- deallocates EPA2 so other users can have it.
jdisp xxx DEVICE=EPA1	- displays on EPA1.
.level1
.var device
Physical device name
of display device to grab
.level2
.var device
DEVICE specifies the physical device name of a display device to grab
for use by VIDS as the current device.  Use the SHOWDISP command to see
what devices are available on your system.

If you don't specify DEVICE, and you have used the USE command to allocate
a display device, JGRAB will grab that device.
