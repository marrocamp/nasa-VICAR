JGRDISP will display an IBIS Graphics-1 format file on the
graphics overlay plane.  For 2-D IBIS Graphics-1 files, the
COLOR parameter can be used to specify the color in which to
display.  For 3-D Graphics-1 files, pens and zscale can be
used to specify the colors.  Documentation on the IBIS file
formats may be obtained from the MIPL librarian.

.vari inp
INP is an IBIS (Image Based Information System) "Graphics-1"
file containing points to display on the graphics plane.

Since IBIS files contain no information as to whether they
are 2-D or 3-D, make sure that the DIM parameter is set to
the proper value.
.vari dim
The DIM parameter specifies how many dimensions the Graphics-1
file contains.  Note that this is a special use of dimension, in
that it describes the number of "columns" in the Graphics-1 file,
not the number of dimensions that VICAR says the file has.  There
is no indication in the Graphics-1 file as to what the dimensionality
of the file is, therefore if it is not two (the default for DIM), then
the DIM parameter must be specified in order for JGRDISP to behave
correctly.
.vari pens
The PENS parameter is an integer specifying how many pens or colors
are available.  This number of colors will be used to draw the
different objects in a 3-D file.  The colors will be determined by
the z value in the file, optionally scaled (see ZSCALE).  The order
of colors is:  red, green, blue, white, black, yellow, cyan, and magenta.
.vari zscale
The ZSCALE parameter is a real number specifying a scaling factor to
be applied to the z value in the graphics file.  If ZSCALE is specified,
then each z value is multiplied by ZSCALE, and that numbered pen (from
1 to the number of pens available, PENS) is used to draw that object.
If zscale is not specified, then the range of z values is scanned and
ZSCALE is automatically calculated to fit the range.  The order of
colors is:  red, green, blue, white, black, yellow, cyan, and magenta.
.vari color
The COLOR parameter is a keyword indicating in which color to display
2-D graphics files.  For 3-D files, COLOR is ignored.  Valid values are
red, green, blue, white, black, yellow, cyan, and magenta.

The default is red.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
