VIDS Command JLIST
.help
The JLIST command will list the pixel values from a given area of
the display to the terminal screen.  The size of the area listed is
automatically computed from the size of your terminal screen.

Only one image plane can be listed at a time.  To print the pixel
values for more than one plane, multiple JLIST commands must be given
with a different value of PLANE for each.

The location the pixels are listed from can be controlled interactively
via the cursor, or by the command line with the LOCATION parameter.
For the interactive case, a small box will follow the cursor around on
the screen indicating the size of the area to be listed.  Button 1
(or the keyboard equivalent) will list the current location, then
wait for another button press.  Button 2 will cancel the operation.
.page
The location specified is, by default, the center of the area.  If
you set the REFERENC keyword to 'HOME, the location will be in the
upper left corner of the area.

The pixel values will normally be listed before the stretch is applied.
If you want to see the effect the stretch has on the pixels, use the
'STRETCHED keyword.

Examples:

JLIST GREEN			- Interactively lists DNs from the green plane
JLIST LOC=(256,256)		- Lists the center of the BW plane
JLIST LOC=(1,1) 'HOME 'STR	- Lists stretched data from upper left of plane
.level1
.vari plane
Plane to list from
.vari location
Location to list from;
interactive if not given
.vari stretch
Selects STRETCHED or
UNSTRETCHED data
.vari referenc
Location is center (CENTER)
or top left (HOME)?
.vari device
Name of device to use
.level2
.vari plane
The PLANE parameter lists the image plane to be used for the listings.
Only one plane may be specified.  If you need more than one, issue
multiple JLIST commands.  The default is BW.

Any valid plane name or number may be given, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE,
or GRAPHICS.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.
.vari location
The LOCATION parameter specifies the point around which to list the
pixel values.  It is a pair of integers of the form (line,sample).
The coordinates are always relative to the image plane in the PLANE
parameter.

By default, LOCATION is the center of the rectangular area being listed.
If you specify 'HOME, however, then LOCATION is the upper left corner of
the rectangle.

If you do not give LOCATION, then the location will be defined
interactively using the cursor.  You will be prompted with instructions.
.vari stretch
STRETCH controls whether or not to use the look-up table (LUT) for the
plane.  If 'UNSTRETCHED is given, the raw data from the image memory is
listed.  If 'STRETCHED is given, the raw data is passed through the LUT
before being listed.  This allows you to see the effect of your contrast
enhancement on the data.
.vari referenc
The REFERENC parameter indicates whether the location for the list
(the cursor position or the LOCATION parameter) is to be centered
in the listing area (REFERENC=CENTER) or positioned in the upper left
corner of the listing area (REFERENC=HOME).  The default is CENTER.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
