VIDS command JBW
.help
The JBW command will place the active display device into black
and white mode, and optionally (via the PLANE parameter) will 
change the image memory plane used for black and white viewing.

Upon VIDS startup, the black and white plane is set to the
same image plane as the red plane.

The image plane is specifiable either as a name or a number.  See
HELP for the PLANE parameter for details of specifying image planes.
If an image plane other than "BW" is specified to JBW, the reserved plane
name "BW" is changed to reflect the new black and white plane.

Related commands: JCOLOR - put device into color mode.

Examples:
		JBW		! view current black and white
				! plane in b&w
		JBW GREEN	! view green plane in b&w
		JBW 12		! view plane 12 in black and white

PLANE is the image memory plane which is to be used for viewing
black and white frames.  It may be either a plane name or an 
absolute plane number.  You can find out what planes are available
with the JSHOW-DEVICE command.

An image plane name may be one of the predefined names BW, RED,
GREEN, BLUE, COLOR, GRAPHICS, or VISIBLE, or it may be a name
defined by you with the JDEFNAME command.  See HELP PLANENAMES
for more information.

Examples:
		JBW		! view current black and white
				! plane in b&w
		JBW GREEN	! view green plane in b&w
		JBW 12		! view plane 12 in black and white
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
