VIDS command JPSEUDO
.help
The JPSEUDO command will place the active display device into
pseudocolor mode, and will optionally change the image memory
plane and the pseudocolor table used.

Pseudocolor mode assigns colors to different gray levels, which
tends to enhance the contrast of black and white images.  The
colors used can be chosen by using one of the eight built-in
pseudocolor tables, or you may change them using JPSEDIT.
Each image memory plane has its own table.  To copy pseudocolor
tables from one plane to another, use JPSCOPY.

The pseudocolor table is applied AFTER the contrast stretch.
So, stretching the image (using JSTRETCH) will cause the colors
assigned to any particular feature on the screen to change.

The image memory plane used is the current "BW" plane.  This may
be changed with the PLANE parameter, which also changes the
reserved plane name "BW" to reflect the new black and white plane.

The built-in pseudocolor table used is selected with the TABLE
parameter.  Eight tables are available, starting at 0.  Table
0 is a black and white ramp, which looks identical to black and
white mode.  Tables 1 through 7 have various numbers of colors.
See the help for the TABLE parameter for what is in the tables.

If you do not give a table number, the pseudocolor table is not
changed.  The default table number is 1.

Related commands: JBW - put device into black and white mode.
                  JCOLOR - put device into color mode.

Examples:

JPSEUDO 1			! sets pseudo mode on plane 1
JPSEUDO TABLE=3			! sets pseudo mode using table 3 on BW plane
JBW				! sets b&w mode on current BW plane
JPSEUDO				! sets pseudocolor mode on current BW plane
JPSEUDO PLANE=3 TABLE=7		! sets pseudo mode on plane 3 using table 7

PLANE is the image memory plane which is to be used for viewing
pseudocolor images.  It may be either a plane name or an
absolute plane number.  You can find out what planes are
available with the JSHOW-DEVICE command.

An image plane name may be one of the predefined names such
as BW, RED, GREEN, or GRAPHICS, or it may be a name defined
by you with the JDEF-PLANE command.  See HELP PLANENAMES
for more information.

If PLANE is not given, the current BW plane is used.
.vari table
TABLE is the built-in pseudocolor table to use.  The tables are:

0     A black and white pseudocolor table.  Looks like BW mode.
1     Eight (8) color pseudocolor table ( 32 DN color density slice ).
2     Sixteen (16) color pseudocolor table ( 16 DN color density slice ).
3     Thirty-two (32) color pseudocolor table ( 8 DN color density slice).
4     Sixteen (16) color pseudocolor table ( 16 DN color density slice).
5     Eight (8) color pseudocolor table ( 32 DN color density slice).
6     Six (6) color pseudocolor table ( 43 DN color density slice).
7     Four (4) color pseudocolor table ( 64 DN color density slice).

The table for a plane may be changed using JPSEDIT.  This does not change
the built-in tables, just the plane's copy of them.  The pseudocolor is
applied after the contrast stretch, so changing the stretch (using
JSTRETCH) will change the appearance of the pseudocolor table.

The JWEDGE command is useful for looking at the current pseudocolor table.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
