VIDS command JPSCOPY
.help
The current pseudocolor tables being used are saved according to
the planes viewed; that is, every plane has its own table.  The
JPSCOPY command is used to copy the pseudocolor table being applied
to one plane to another plane.  JPSCOPY does not copy the stretch;
only the pseudocolor table.  Use JSTRETCH-COPY to copy the stretch.

Examples:

JPSCOPY BW 3			! Apply the current BW table to plane 3
JPSCOPY RED BW			! Use the table for the RED plane on the BW
				! plane; if RED and BW are the same,
				! nothing will happen.
JPSCOPY 2 3			! Copy the table on plane 2 to plane 3
.level1
.vari plane1
Plane of source
pseudocolor table
.vari plane2
Plane of destination
pseudo table
.vari device
Name of device to use
.level2
.vari plane1
The PLANE1 parameter specifies the plane whose pseudocolor table is to be
copied.  The entire table is copied directly to the pseudocolor table
for the plane PLANE2.

PLANE1 behaves the same as the standard VIDS plane parameter.  It 
may be either a plane name or an integer.  See HELP PLANENAMES
for details of how to use plane names.
.vari plane2
The PLANE2 parameter specifies the plane to which the pseudocolor table
of PLANE1 is to be copied.  The entire table is copied directly.

PLANE2 behaves the same as the standard VIDS plane parameter.  It 
may be either a plane name or an integer.  See HELP PLANENAMES
for details of how to use plane names.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
