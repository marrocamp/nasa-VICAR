VIDS command JLOAD
.help
The JLOAD command is used to load images, stretch tables, or pseudocolor
tables from a file into the display device.  JLOAD takes subcommands
to describe the type of file to load, so the command takes the form:

JLOAD-subcmd parms

where "subcmd" describes the type of file to load, and "parms"
indicates additional parameters which vary among the subcommands.
For further information on a given subcommand, type "HELP JLOAD-subcmd",
or, for a list of subcommands available and help on each, "TUTOR JLOAD-".

.subcmd image
JLOAD-IMAGE will load the specified band from the input file into the
specified image memory plane.  Only one plane may be loaded per JLOAD-IMAGE
command.  The loaded plane is not made visible if it is not currently visible,
thus JLOAD-IMAGE may be used to load a number of image planes which are not
visible so that they could then be displayed at device refresh rates.  To
view the loaded plane, the JBW command may be used to make it the current
black and white plane.
.vari inp -image
The INP parameter is a string specifying a file to be loaded.  A
file name must be specified.  To redisplay an image or reload what
was previously loaded, use the JDISP command.
.vari plane -image
The PLANE parameter can be used to specify an image memory plane
into which the image band will be loaded.  PLANE is the standard
VIDS PLANE parameter.  It may either be the name of a plane or a
number.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details of how to use image plane
names.

The default is BW, the current black and white image plane.
.vari band -image
The BAND parameter is an integer specifying which band of the input
file should be loaded.  The number of bands in the input may be listed
with the LABEL-LIST command.  The default is to load the first band.
.vari area -image
The AREA parameter is a set of four integers specifying the area of
the input file to be loaded.  It is of the form AREA=(sl,ss,nl,ns),
where the fields are as follows:

	sl:	Starting line of input image to load
	ss:	Starting sample of input image to load
	nl:	Number of lines to load
	ns:	Number of samples to load
.vari location -image
The LOCATION parameter is an integer parameter used to specify the
location on the display device at which the upper left corner of the
image should be loaded.  For example, to load a 256 line by 256 sample
image in the bottom right corner of a 512 by 512 pixel display,
"LOCATION=(257,257)" could be specified.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
.subcmd stretch
JLOAD-STRETCH loads one or more stretch lookup tables from a file.

The file is in IBIS tabular format, with each table being a separate
column and each column 256 entries long.  This allows you to use all
the standard IBIS programs for manipulating your stretch files.  For
example, you could combine two separate tables into one file using
the IBIS program COPYFILE.

The columns to be loaded may be selected with the COLUMNS parameter.

Stretch files are compatible with pseudocolor files.  That allows
you, for example, to save a set of three stretches and load them back in
as a pseudocolor table (which takes three tables, one for each
of red, green, and blue).
.vari inp -stretch
The INP parameter is a string specifying a file to be loaded.  A
file name must be specified.  The file should be in IBIS tabular
format, with each stretch table being a column and each column 256
entries long.
.vari planes -stretch
The PLANES parameter can be used to specify the image memory planes
into which the stretch tables will be loaded.  PLANES is the standard
VIDS PLANES parameter.  It may either be the name of a plane or a
number.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details of how to use image plane
names.

The default is IMAGE.
.vari columns -stretch
The COLUMNS parameter specifies which columns of the input file are to
be used.  VIDS stores its stretch tables in IBIS tabular format, with
each table a column and each column 256 entries long.  There may be many
columns in a file, and thus many lookup tables stored together.

Each plane uses one entry from the COLUMNS list.  If you don't give enough
columns, or you don't enter COLUMNS at all, then defaults will be used.  The
default is to count up in sequential order for each plane, starting at the
last column you specified, or 1 if you didn't specify any.

Columns are numbered starting at 1, and you may repeat column numbers.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
.subcmd pseudo
JLOAD-PSEUDO loads a pseudocolor table from a file.

The file is in IBIS tabular format, with each table being three
columns and each column 256 entries long.  This allows you to use all
the standard IBIS programs for manipulating your stretch files.  For
example, you could combine two separate tables into one file using
the IBIS program COPYFILE.

Three columns are always loaded, one each for the red, green, and
blue portions of the pseudocolor table.  The columns to be loaded
may be selected with the COLUMNS parameter.
.page
Pseudocolor table files are compatible with stretch files.  That
allows you, for example, to save a pseudocolor table and load it
back as a set of three stretches.

JLOAD-PSEUDO will NOT put you into pseudocolor mode if you are
not in it already.  This makes works the same way as JLOAD-IMAGE,
which doesn't make sure the plane you loaded is visible.  To see
the newly loaded pseudocolor table, simply issue the JPSEUDO
command.
.vari inp -pseudo
The INP parameter is a string specifying a file to be loaded.  A
file name must be specified.  The file should be in IBIS tabular
format, with each component of the pseudocolor table being a
column and each column 256 entries long.
.vari plane -pseudo
The PLANE parameter can be used to specify the image memory plane
into which the pseudocolor table will be loaded.  PLANE is the standard
VIDS PLANE parameter.  It may either be the name of a plane or a
number.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details of how to use image plane
names.

The default is BW (which is also the current pseudocolor plane).
.vari columns -pseudo
The COLUMNS parameter specifies which columns of the input file are to
be used.  VIDS stores its pseudocolor tables in IBIS tabular format,
with each part of the table (red, green, blue) a column and each column
256 entries long.  There may be many columns in a file, and thus many
sets of pseudocolor tables stored together.

JLOAD-PSEUDO uses three entries from the COLUMNS list.  If you don't
give enough columns, or you don't enter COLUMNS at all, then defaults
will be used.  The default is to count up in sequential order for each
plane, starting at the last column you specified, or 1 if you didn't
specify any.

Columns are numbered starting at 1, and you may repeat column numbers.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
