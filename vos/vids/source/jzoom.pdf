VIDS command JZOOM
.help
The JZOOM command will zoom (magnify) image planes to the factor
specified.  By default, the zoom will be centered on the current
cursor position.  If a region name is supplied, then JZOOM will
zoom the image planes so that the data within the region fills
the screen.

A location is always used to position the zoom.  If the REFERENC
parameter is CENTER, the zoom is centered on the location.  If
REFERENC is HOME, the location will be the new upper left corner.

If the LOCATION parameter is given, that location is used to position
the zoom.  If a region is given, then the region location is used.
Otherwise, the current cursor position is used.
.page
When the SOURCE parameter is BEST, JZOOM will give the fastest zoom
available at the best resolution possible.  In this case, the zoom
factor refers to an absolute zoom relative to the image file.

See the examples on the next page.

Examples:

JZOOM 2				- Magnify 2 times relative to image file

JZOOM 2 'DISP			- Perform a hardware zoom of 2, regardless
				- of current magnification

JZOOM REG=FOO			- Magnify the region FOO to fit on the screen

JZOOM 3 LOC=(50,50) 'FIL 'HO	- Equivalent to: JDISP SL=50 SS=50 ZOOM=3

JZOOM 6 RED			- Zoom red plane by 6, centered on cursor

JZOOM -9			- Reload image files at -9 magnification

.vari factor
FACTOR is the  magnification factor to be applied to the image.   If
SOURCE is  BEST or FILE, then  FACTOR is relative  to the image file
itself.  If SOURCE is DISPLAY, then FACTOR is a hardware zoom factor
to be applied.

Note that only positive zooms up to a certain number (such as 8 or 16)
are available in hardware (SOURCE=DISPLAY).

A negative zoom factor indicates that the picture will be shrunk by
that factor; for example, FACTOR=-3 would cause every third pixel in
the input image to be displayed (starting with 1).

The FACTOR parameter overrides the automatic zoom calculated from the
REGION parameter.  If neither FACTOR nor REGION is given, the zoom factor
defaults to 1.
.vari planes
The PLANES parameter can be used to specify a list of planes to be
zoomed.  The planes need not be visible to be zoomed.
PLANES is the standard VIDS plane parameter, which can be
either a name of a plane (such as RED, GREEN, COLOR, etc.) or an
actual plane number (1,2,3...).  See HELP PLANENAMES for detail.

Many devices will not allow image planes to be zoomed independently
of one another.  In this case, VIDS will inform you that all planes
must be zoomed together and will zoom all planes.
.vari location
The LOCATION parameter specifies a location about which to zoom.
The REFERENC parameter specifies whether this location is to be
interpreted as the center (REFERENC=CENTER) or the upper left
(REFERENC=HOME) of the area.

If LOCATION is not specified, the current cursor location is
used; that is, the image will be zoomed centered on the current
cursor position.

Unless the zoom is forced to be local to the display (SOURCE=DISPLAY),
the LOCATION is in image file coordinates.
.vari region
REGION specifies the name of a region on which to zoom.  The zoom
is centered on that region, and a factor is calculated to zoom the
region as large as possible and still fit on the screen.  If FACTOR
is specified, that factor will override the calculated factor for
the zoom.  If REFERENC=HOME is specified, the upper left of the 
region will be panned to the upper left of the display.

If neither FACTOR nor REGION is given, the zoom factor defaults to 1.
.vari source
The SOURCE parameter specifies whether the zoom should be performed
from the image file (FILE), local to the hardware (DISPLAY), or an
optimal combination of the two (BEST).  If SOURCE=BEST, the zoom
factor is interpreted in reference to the image file, so that a 
zoom of one would always load each pixel up to the size of the image
plane with no subsampling (if a load were necessary).

By default, an "optimal" zoom will be performed.  If the zoom is 
negative (zooming out) or greater than the hardware will support,
then the hardware zoom will be reset to a zoom of one, and the image
will be redisplayed at the requested zoom factor.  If the zoom is
positive and within the range of the hardware capability, the image
will be redisplayed at a zoom of one if necessary and a hardware zoom
applied.
.vari referenc
The REFERENC parameter indicates whether the location for the zoom
(the cursor position, the region location, or the LOCATION parameter)
is to be centered on the screen (REFERENC=CENTER) or positioned in
the upper left corner of the screen (REFERENC=HOME).  By default the
point of interest (usually the cursor location) will be centered on
the screen after zooming.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
