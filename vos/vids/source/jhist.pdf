VIDS command JHIST
.help
JHIST plots histograms on the graphics plane.  The histogram for any
number of planes can be plotted in the same command.  JHIST can collect
histograms over any arbitrarily shaped region.  It can also plot
the histograms in any rectangular region, in several different formats.

JHIST always collects the histogram from the image plane.  If your
image is larger than the image plane, you will get a histogram of
only what is displayed, not what is in the file.

VIDS tries to keep histograms valid as much as possible; however, it
sometimes is necessary for the histogram to be collected again.  If
the histogram needs to be collected, you will notice a short delay
before it is plotted.  This will most often happen if you are
collecting over regions other than the default.  It will also happen
the first time you use a histogram or automatic stretch command on
a particular image.
.page
By default, JHIST uses only the raw data in the image plane; i.e.
contrast stretches are not taken into account.  To get a histogram
of the stretched data, use the 'STRETCHED keyword.

Two different types of regions are used by JHIST.  The first, and
most important, is the REGION parameter.  This parameter specifies
the region on the screen to use while collecting the histogram.
It defaults to the size of the last image that was displayed.

The second type, in the DISPRGN parameter, gives the region(s) to
plot each histogram in.  Using DISPRGN, you can make the
histograms any size you like, and put them anywhere on the screen.
COLOR can also be used to change the color they are displayed in.
.page
The histogram(s) can be plotted with the DN axis either vertical
(using 'VERTICAL, the default) or horizontal (using 'HORIZONTAL).
The plotting of the label, which includes the DN value labels,
the axis tic marks, and the statistics, is controlled by the
'LABEL (default) and 'NOLABEL keyword parameters.

JHIST calculates the mean and standard deviation of the histogram,
and prints them both on the terminal and on the graphics plane, unless
'NOLABEL is given.

.vari planes
The PLANES parameter lists the image planes to be used for the histograms.
Any number of planes may be specified.  Each plane gets its own histogram,
plotted in its own display area.  The default is IMAGE, which means one
histogram is plotted in black and white mode, and three histograms are
plotted in color mode (one each for the red, green, and blue planes).

Any valid plane names or numbers may be given, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE,
COLOR, GRAPHICS, or VISIBLE.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.

If 'STRETCHED is given, then there must be a look-up table available to
send the histogram through.  For this reason, only the current RED, GREEN,
BLUE and BW planes are allowed if 'STRETCHED is given.

If more than three to six planes are specified, the defaults for DISPRGN
and COLOR may be inadequate, and you might have to give them values.  See
the help for DISPRGN and COLOR for more details.
.vari region
The REGION parameter specifies the region on the screen over which to
collect the histogram.  Only points inside the region are used to
calculate the histogram.  The region may be any arbitrary shape.
Regions are defined using JDEF-REGION.

The default is to use the area in which you last displayed an image,
using JDISP or JLOAD-IMAGE.
.vari spike
The SPIKE parameter specifies the number of spikes to saturate to
the maximum value.

Intuitively, a spike is a DN value with a much larger count than
the rest of the histogram, which appears as a 'spike' on the graph.
When the histogram is scaled to fit in the display area, this spike
can overwhelm all the other DN values, and the graph ends up with
most values close to the axis, making it hard to read.  Giving a
higher value for SPIKE (the default is 1) will tend to spread out
the graph more, by eliminating some of the spikes from the scaling
routine.  This allows you to see more detail in the histogram.
.page
Technically, a spike is defined as follows. The frequency of the DN
level with the greatest frequency of occurrence in the picture is
the spike of ordinal number one. The frequency of the DN level with
the r'th greatest frequency of occurrence in the picture is the spike
of ordinal number r.  When the SPIKE parameter is invoked, the frequency
of the spike with ordinal number n+1 becomes the maximum value in the
display of the histogram. All DN levels with frequencies greater than
the normalization frequency are set equal to the normalization
frequency for the purpose of the display. All the other frequencies
are scaled with respect to the normalization frequency. This scaling
does not affect the statistics printed out with the histogram.
.vari disprgn
DISPRGN specifies the areas on the screen in which the histograms are
plotted.  Any rectangular region may be used to display a histogram, which
is scaled to fit in the region.  If a non-rectangular region is given, the
bounding rectangle is used.  Regions are defined using JDEF-REGION.

Each individual plane uses its own display region.  That means if you specify,
for example, COLOR as a plane name, it will actually take three display
regions, since COLOR is a collection of the red, green, and blue planes.

If you do not give a display region for a plane, a default is assigned.
There are six default display regions named HIST1, HIST2, ..., HIST6.
They are arranged on the screen like this:
		+---------+
		| 1  2  3 |
		| 4  5  6 |
		+---------+
You may change the size and location these regions using JDEF-REGION.
.page
Defaults are assigned as follows for the 'NOSTRETCHED case.  If the
plane is the current red plane, it goes in HIST1.  Likewise, if it is
the green plane it goes in HIST2, and the blue plane goes in HIST3.
The bw plane (if in bw mode) goes back in HIST1.  If it is not one of
those four, then it goes in HIST4, HIST5, and HIST6 in rotation; i.e.
the first of these planes goes in HIST4, the second in HIST5, and so
on.  If a plane is both the current red and green planes, it goes in
both the red and green locations.

If 'STRETCHED is given, the defaults are different.  The red plane goes
in HIST4, the green in HIST5, the blue in HIST6, and the bw (if in
bw mode) back in HIST4.  If it is not one of those four, then it goes
in HIST4, HIST5, and HIST6 in rotation, just like for the 'NOSTRETCHED
case.  If a plane is both the current red and green planes, it goes in
both the red and green locations.

.vari color
COLOR specifies the graphics colors to use in plotting each histogram.
The valid colors are:  RED, GREEN, BLUE, WHITE, CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW,
and BLACK.

Each individual plane uses its own display color.  That means if you specify,
for example, COLOR as a plane name, it will actually take three display
colors, since COLOR is a collection of the red, green, and blue planes.

If you don't give enough colors for all the planes, then the last color
you give will be used for all the other planes.  This allows you to say,
for example, COLOR=BLACK and have all the histograms plotted in black.

If you don't specify any colors, defaults will be assigned.  If the plane
is the current red plane, the color RED will be used.  Likewise, the green
plane will use GREEN and the blue plane will use BLUE.  The bw plane uses
RED.  If the plane is not one of those four, then the color used cycles
between MAGENTA, YELLOW, and CYAN.
.vari STRETCH
STRETCH controls whether or not to use the look-up table (LUT) for the
planes.  If 'NOSTRETCHED is given, the raw data from the image memory is
used.  If 'STRETCHED is given, the raw data is passed through the LUT
before being plotted.  This allows you to see the effect of your contrast
enhancement on the histogram.

The use of STRETCH affects the choice of the default display regions.
See the help for the DISPRGN parameter for more details.
.vari orient
ORIENT controls the orientation of the histogram.  All histograms
plotted using a single command use the same orientation.  The default
is VERTICAL.

VERTICAL means the DN axis is vertical on the left side, with the
histogram values extending toward the right.  0 is at the bottom,
and 255 is at the top.

HORIZONTAL means the DN axis is horizontal at the bottom, with the
histogram values extending up.  0 is at the left, and 255 is at
the right.
.vari label
The LABEL keyword parameter specifies whether or not to plot labels
for the DN axis.  If 'LABEL is given (the default), then a scale of
DN values is plotted on the DN axis, and tic marks drawn on the axis.
Statistics are also printed at the bottom.  The size of the area used
to plot the data is reduced to make room for these items.  The label
and statistics are always plotted inside the display region.

If 'NOLABEL is given, then neither the scale, the tic marks, nor the
statistics are drawn.  Instead, the histogram data area takes up the
entire display region.  This is useful to get a full-resolution histogram.
For example, on a 512X512 display device, you can define four 256X256
regions to put your histograms in.  If the labels are plotted, the data
area of the histogram will be shrunk to make room.  Since the DN axis is
now smaller than 256, you will lose some resolution as some DN values will
be plotted on top of each other.  If you give 'NOLABEL, the DN axis can be
a full 256 pixels and you can see every DN value.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
