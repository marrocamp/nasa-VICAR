VIDS command JCOLOR
.help
JCOLOR is used to put the display device into color mode.  The
image planes used for the three colors red, green, and blue, respectively,
may be specified positionally with the PLANES parameter.  If nothing is
specified for PLANES, the current red, green, and blue planes
are used.  The current planes are initialized to the first three
image planes of the device if 3 or more are available.

Note that JCOLOR changes the meaning of the plane names RED, GREEN,
and BLUE to reflect the new color planes, so that each color name
always refers to the plane which is being viewed in that color.
Thus, regardless of which image planes are currently used to view
color, the command

JCOLOR (RED,GREEN,BLUE) 

would have no effect.  The sequence of the commands:

JCOLOR (RED,BLUE,GREEN)
JCOLOR (RED,BLUE,GREEN)

would swap the green and blue planes with each command, resulting
in returning to the original display.

Examples:
	JCOLOR			! go into color mode, default planes
	JCOLOR (3,2,4)		! Color mode, plane 3 as red, 
				! 2 as green, and 4 as blue
	JCOLOR (RED,BLUE,GREEN)	! swap green and blue
	JCOLOR (RED,BLUE,GREEN)	! swap green and blue again.

The PLANES parameter is used to specify which planes to view 
as red, green, and blue, respectively.  Any valid plane names
or numbers may be given, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE, COLOR, GRAPHICS,
or VISIBLE.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.

The plane names RED, GREEN, and BLUE are redefined to correspond
with the first, second, and third names given, respectively.  Thus,
the command:

JCOLOR (RED,GREEN,BLUE) 

will never produce any change (except, of course, to put the device
into color mode if it is not already).
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
