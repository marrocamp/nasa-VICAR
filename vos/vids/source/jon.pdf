Planes to turn on

Name of device to use

The JON command will turn on all of the output lookup tables associated
with each plane listed.  Any plane name may be specified; note, however,
that if the device is in black and white mode, the planes RED, GREEN, or
BLUE may not produce the desired effect.

The lookup tables may be turned off by using the JOFF command.

Examples:
	JOFF			! turn off all visible planes
	JON			! turn them all back on.
	JOFF			! off again
	JON RED			! turn on the red plane.
	JON (GREEN,BLUE)	! turn on the green and blue planes
	JON GRAPHICS		! turn on the graphics plane
.vari planes
PLANES is used to specify which planes to turn on.  All lookup tables
associated with that plane are turned on; i.e., they are restored from
their last saved values.  They may turned off again with the JOFF
command.

PLANES may take any valid plane name, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE, COLOR,
GRAPHICS, or VISIBLE.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
