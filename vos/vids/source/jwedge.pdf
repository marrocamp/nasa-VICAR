VIDS command JWEDGE
.help
JWEDGE allows you to draw a gray-scale "wedge" in the image planes.
A wedge is a rectangle of pixels that starts at black (or a dim value)
on one end and gradually increases to white (or a brighter value) on
the other end.

You can control the planes the wedge is drawn in, the region on the
screen it's drawn in, the starting pixel value, the ending pixel
value, and the number of steps in the wedge by using the various
parameters.
.level1
.vari PLANES
Image planes to draw the
wedge in.
.vari REGION
Display region for the wedge.
.vari MIN
Minimum pixel value
(on the left side)
.vari MAX
Maximum pixel value
(on the right side)
.vari NSTEPS
Number of discrete steps
to put in the wedge.
.vari device
Name of device to use
.level2
.vari PLANES
The PLANES parameter lists the image planes to draw the wedge in.  Any
number of planes may be specified.  The default is IMAGE, so the wedge
will end up as a gray scale even in color mode (since the same wedge is
drawn for each color).

Any valid plane names or numbers may be given, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE,
COLOR, VISIBLE.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.
.vari REGION
REGION defines the display region to use for the wedge.  If you specify
a non-rectangular region, the bounding rectangle of the region is used.

The default for REGION is the predefined region "WEDGE".  You may
redefine "WEDGE" to change the default position using JDEF-REGION
if you wish.
.vari MIN
MIN is the minimum (dimmest) pixel value to use for the wedge.  The
leftmost pixel in the region gets the value specified.

The default is 0.
.vari MAX
MAX is the maximum (brightest) pixel value to use for the wedge.  The
rightmost pixel in the region gets the value specified.

The default is 255.
.vari NSTEPS
NSTEPS specifies how many discrete steps to put in the wedge.  The wedge
is broken up into NSTEPS equal areas.  Each area has a constant pixel
value throughout the area, while different areas have different pixel
values.  The net result with small values for NSTEPS is a "staircase"
effect in the wedge.

The default is 256, which is the smoothest wedge possible (since there
are only 256 possible pixel values).
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
