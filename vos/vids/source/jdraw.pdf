VIDS Command JDRAW
.help
The JDRAW command is used to draw objects in the graphics plane.
The objects may be defined either interactively with the cursor, or
via the command line.

The available shapes are LINE, SEGMENTS, POLYGON, RECT, SQUARE, OVAL,
CIRCLE, and ARROW.  These shapes are described under the help for the
SHAPE parameter.

Shapes are defined interactively with the cursor unless the POINTS
parameter is given.  For rectangles, squares, circles, and ovals,
two points must be specified, representing two opposite corners of
a rectangle bounding the required shape.  For polygons and segments
(a non-closed polygon), each vertex must be specified.  For lines
and arrows, the two endpoints are specified.
.page
The color used to draw the shapes is defined with the JSET-COLOR
command.  See the help for JSET-COLOR for more on setting the color.

Most shapes can optionally be filled with the 'FILL keyword.  The entire
interior of the shape is filled with the color defined in JSET-COLOR.
Shapes that don't have an interior, like LINE, SEGMENTS, and ARROW, can
not be filled.

It is important to note that anything drawn in the graphics plane will
totally obscure the image pixels underneath.  There is no way to blend
the image with the graphics.  You may see the obscured parts of the image
by turning the graphics plane off (JOFF GRAPHICS) or by drawing over parts
of the image with the special graphics color TRANSPARENT (set with
JSET-COLOR), which erases the graphics.
.page
There is no connection between JDRAW and JDEF-REGION, despite some
similarites in what shapes are available and how they are defined.
You cannot use JDRAW to define a region, and it is not recommended
to use JDEF-REGION to draw graphics, because you can't control the
color, and the available shapes are more limited.

Examples:

JDRAW SQUARE			- Draws a square interactively
JDRAW OVAL (10,10,50,90) 'FILL	- Draws and fills an oval at the given location
JDRAW ARROW (1,1,256,256)	- Draws an arrow with the tail in the upper
				- left and the head in the middle of the screen

.vari shape
Shape desired. See HELP
SHAPE for valid shapes.
.vari points
List of points in shape
(Use cursor if not given;
see also SHAPE)
.vari fill
Fills the shape with color
.vari device
Name of device to use
.level2
.vari shape
The SHAPE parameter defines the shape to use for the graphic
object.

The next page describes the allowed shapes.
.page
   LINE:     A single line.  This is the default.
   RECT:     A rectangle.
   SQUARE:   A square.  Identical to RECT except that it will be restricted
             to a square, so that the longer of the two dimensions is
             shortened to equal the shorter.
   OVAL:     An ellipse.  The ellipse will touch the bounding rectangle of
             the object in the center of each of the four sides.
   CIRCLE:   A circle.  Identical to OVAL except that it will be restricted
             to a circle in the same fashion that a SQUARE shape will be
             restricted from a rectangle.
   POLYGON:  An irregular polygon.  A polygon is any list of points defining
             vertices;  it may cross itself, be concave, convex, etc.  For
             example, an hourglass would be a valid polygon.
   SEGMENTS: A series of connected lines.  Identical to POLYGON except the
             end is not connected to the beginning.
   ARROW:    An arrow.  Identical to LINE except the second endpoint has
             an arrowhead drawn at it.  The first point is always the tail;
             the second point is always the head of the arrow.
.vari points
The POINTS parameter is used to specify a list of points in the shape.
The points are given in terms of graphics plane coordinates.  If no
points are given by the POINTS parameter, you must trace out the 
shape interactively on the display device.

For all shapes except polygons and segments, two points should be
specified, defining two opposite corners of the rectangle bounding
the shape, in the format points=(l1,s1,l2,s2), where (l1,s1) defines
the line and sample coordinates of one point, and (l2,s2) defines the
line and sample coordinates of the opposite corner.  In the case of lines
and arrows, the two points are the endpoints of the line.  If the shape
is a polygon or a segment, then POINTS specifies the list of points
defining the vertices of the shape, points=(l1,s1,l2,s2,...,ln,sn).
Each point on the list will be connected to the next point on the list.
For polygons only, the last point, (ln,sn), is connected to the first
point (l1,s1) to close the polygon.
.vari fill
The FILL keyword parameter allows you to easily fill the shape with the
current color.  The default is no fill, in which case only the outline
of the shape is drawn.  The interior is left blank.  If you specify
'FILL, however, the interior is filled with the current graphics color
(defined with JSET-COLOR).

Shapes that don't have an interior, like LINE, SEGMENTS, and ARROW,
can not be filled.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
