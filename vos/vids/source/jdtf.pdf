VIDS command JDTF
.help
JDTF displays transfer functions, or look-up tables (LUTs), on the
graphics plane, and optionally edits them.  It displays a plot of
the input DN (pixel value) versus the output DN.  This gives a
graphical representation of the contrast stretch currently in use.

The LUT for any number of image planes may be displayed at once.
The default is IMAGE, which is the BW plane in black-and-white mode,
and a collection of the three color planes in color mode.

The location of the plots on the display is controlled via the
DISPRGN parameter.  The LUTs for all the planes get plotted in
the same display area.  See the help for DISPRGN for more details.

The color of the plots can be changed using the COLOR parameter.  See
the help for COLOR.
.page
Axis labeling, including tic marks and a DN value scale, is controlled
by the LABEL parameter.  The default is to plot the labels.

'EDIT allows you to interactively edit the stretch using the cursor.
See the help for the EDIT parameter for details.

JDTF is the same as JSTRETCH-SHOW, and JDTF 'EDIT is identical to
JSTRETCH-EDIT.

    JDTF			! display LUT for IMAGE planes
    JDTF DISPRGN=A		! display in different location
    JDTF D=FULLSCREEN 'NOLABELS	! no labels, full-screen plot
    JDTF RED			! display LUT for red plane only
    JDTF COLOR=(MAG,YEL,CYA)	! display in different colors
    JDTF PLANE=COLOR COLOR=BLACK ! display the R,G,B planes in black
    JDTF 'EDIT			! edit the LUTs

.vari planes
The PLANES parameter lists the image planes to use for the display.
Any number of planes may be specified.  Each plane's look-up table
(LUT, or transfer function) is plotted in the display area.  The
default is IMAGE, which means one plot is made in black and white
mode, and three plots are produced in color mode (one each for the
red, green, and blue planes).

Any valid plane names or numbers may be given, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE,
COLOR, GRAPHICS, or VISIBLE.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.
.vari disprgn
DISPRGN specifies the area on the screen in which the LUTs are
plotted.  Any rectangular region may be used to display the LUTs,
which are scaled to fit in the region.  If a non-rectangular region
is given, the bounding rectangle is used.  Regions are defined using
JDEF-REGION.  The LUTs for all the planes are displayed in the same
region.

The default for DISPRGN is a pre-defined region called DTF.  This
region is centered in the middle of the screen, and is sized such
that the data area (not including the labels) is 256 X 256 pixels
on a 512 X 512 display.  You may use your own display region, or
even redefine DTF if you wish.
.vari color
COLOR specifies the graphics colors to use in plotting each transfer
function.  COLOR only controls the actual data plot; the axes and
labeling are always plotted in WHITE.  The valid colors are:
RED, GREEN, BLUE, WHITE, CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW, and BLACK.

Each individual plane uses its own display color.  That means if you give,
for example, COLOR as a plane name, it will actually take three display
colors, since COLOR is a collection of the red, green, and blue planes.

If you don't give enough colors for all the planes, then the last color
you give will be used for all the other planes.  This allows you to say,
for example, COLOR=BLACK and have all the LUTs plotted in black.
.page
If you don't specify any colors, defaults will be assigned.  If the plane
is the current red plane, the color RED will be used.  Likewise, the green
plane will use GREEN and the blue plane will use BLUE.  The bw plane uses
RED.  If the plane is not one of those four, then the color used cycles
between MAGENTA, YELLOW, and CYAN.
.vari label
The LABEL keyword parameter specifies whether or not to plot labels
for the axes.  If 'LABEL is given (the default), then a scale of
DN values is plotted on each axis, and tic marks are drawn on the axes.
Text labels identifying the input and output for the transfer function
are also plotted.  The size of the area used to plot the data is reduced
to make room for these items.  The labels are always plotted inside the
display region.

If 'NOLABEL is given, then neither the scale, the tic marks, nor the
text are drawn.  Instead, the data area takes up the entire display
region.  This is useful to get a full-resolution display of the
transfer function.  For example, if you want a one-to-one correspondence
between pixels and DN values, you need a display region that is 256
pixels on a side.  If you define a region 256 pixels on a side, then
plot the labels, the data area will be shrunk to make room, and some
of the DN values will not be plotted.  If you give 'NOLABEL, the data
area is not shrunk and you can see every DN value.
.vari edit
The EDIT keyword parameter allows you to interactively edit the
look-up tables using the cursor.  The planes are edited in sequence,
one plane at a time.  The border of the plot indicates which color
is currently being edited.

The first button is used to edit the LUT.  You edit by creating line
segments.  Position the cursor to one end of the line segment you
want and press the button.  This establishes one end of the segment.
Move the cursor around, and a rubber-band line will follow it.  Press
the button again, and the LUT will be updated with a linear stretch
between the two points.  You are then ready to select the first point
of another segment.  So, pressing button 1 alternates between selecting
the first point and the last point of a linear segment.  To make a
single point, simply press the button twice without moving the cursor.
.page
The second button will cancel the changes to the current look-up table
and move on to the next image plane.  To cancel the entire operation,
you may have to press the button several times to cycle through all the
planes.

The third button accepts the changes to the current look-up table
and moves on to the next image plane.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
