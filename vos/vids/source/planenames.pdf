Referring to Image Planes
.help
Every display device has a certain number of image memory planes
which may be referred to by number from one up to the maximum available
for that device.  Each plane is eight bits deep;  see the "Virtual
Raster Display Interface User's Guide" for details of what an image
memory plane is.  Whenever a VIDS command needs one or more image memory
planes as a parameter, the parameter is always given with the parameter
PLANE (if only one is allowed) or PLANES (if multiple planes are allowed).
The PLANE parameter is a string parameter, thus allowing the user to refer
to a plane either by the plane number or by means of a plane name.

A plane name may refer to a single plane or a collection of planes.  The
user may define his/her own plane names with the JDEF-PLANE command.  In
addition, when a display device is grabbed, certain special plane names
are pre-defined automatically by VIDS.  They follow on the next pages.
.page
	o  RED: The image memory plane to use for displaying the red
	   plane of a color image; i.e., the plane to connect to the red
	   lookup table when in color mode.  Initially, after a JGRAB
	   command, RED=1.

	o  GREEN: The image memory plane to use for displaying the green
	   plane of a color image; i.e., the plane to connect to the green
	   lookup table when in color mode.  Initially, after a JGRAB
	   command, GREEN=2 if two or more planes are available.

	o  BLUE: The image memory plane to use for displaying the blue
	   plane of a color image; i.e., the plane to connect to the blue
	   lookup table when in color mode.  Initially, after a JGRAB
	   command, BLUE=3 if three or more planes are available.

	o  BW:  The image memory plane to use for displaying black and
	   white images in black and white mode.  Initially, after a
	   JGRAB command, BW=1.
.page
	o  GRAPHICS:  The graphics overlay plane.

	o  ALL:  All image memory planes available.  The number of planes
	   is different for different display devices.

	o  COLOR:  The collection (RED, GREEN, BLUE).

	o  IMAGE:  The collection of image planes being viewed.  If the
	   device is in black and white mode, IMAGE is equivalent to BW.
	   If it is in color mode, IMAGE is equivalent to COLOR.

	o  VISIBLE:  The collection of all planes currently visible to
	   the user.  If the graphics overlay is turned on and available,
	   and the display device is in black and white mode, this name
	   is equivalent to (BW,GRAPHICS).  If the display device is in
	   color mode, this name would be equivalent to (COLOR,GRAPHICS).
	   If an image plane has been turned off with the JOFF command,
	   that plane is not included.

Note that the plane names listed here are special, because they are
pre-defined by VIDS for each active display device, and because their
meaning may change as the device configuration changes.  A user defined
plane name always points to the same image plane number, regardless of
the configuration of the device.

Thus, user defined plane names could be useful for defining virtual planes
or unchanging color names in a procedure, as in the following example, where
the user defined name OLDBW is used to save the original black and white
plane.
