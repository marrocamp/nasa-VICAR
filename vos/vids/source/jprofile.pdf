VIDS command JPROFILE
.help
JPROFILE plots DN profiles on the graphics plane.  A profile is a plot
of DN values along a line, called the profile path, versus the position
along the line.  In effect, it is a cross-section of the image along
the path.

The profile for any number of planes may be plotted at once.  The default
is IMAGE, which is the BW plane in black-and-white mode, and a collection
of the three color planes in color mode.

The profile path may be a single line, or it can be a series of connected
line segments of any length.  The DN values are collected along the path,
which may have many bends, and then "straightened out" into a single line
for the plot.  You may notice a delay between issuing the command (or
finishing the path with the cursor) and the plotting of the profile.  This
is caused by the collection of the profile from the image memory planes.
.page
The path can be specified in several ways.  By default, the path is
gathered interactively, using the cursor.  Position the cursor at one end
of the path, and press button 1.  Then position the cursor at all the
other vertices in the path and press button 1 each time.  When you are
done, press button 3.  You specify the path in the same way that you define
a polygonal region.  The only difference is that the profile path is not
closed, meaning the ending point is not connected to the starting point.

You may also specify the path using the POINTS parameter, in which case
you list all the vertices of the path.

The final method for specifying the path is the 'LAST keyword parameter.
'LAST means the path taken is the same path used by the last JPROFILE
command you executed (in this session).  If this is the first JPROFILE
command of the session, the 'LAST keyword is ignored.
.page
There are two ways to display the profile.  The default is horizontal
mode.  In this mode, the X-axis (the axis that measures distance down
the path) is horizontal, and the DN-axis is vertical.  The profile is
displayed in the rectangular region given in the DISPRGN parameter.
Two default regions are provided: PRO1 and PRO2.  PRO1 is at the top of
the screen, and PRO2 is at the bottom.  See the help for the DISPRGN
parameter for more details.

The other display method is called a rotated profile.  In this mode,
the path may be only one line segment (i.e., no bends).  The X-axis
coincides with the path, and the DN-axis is perpendicular to it.
This means the entire plot is rotated to match the slope of the path
line, and is positioned on the path line.  Features in the image are
thus easily matched with the corresponding points in the profile.
Rotated mode is specified using the ROTATE parameter.  'RTOP means
the plot is above the line, and 'RBOTTOM means it is below the line.
See the help for the ROTATE parameter for more information.
.page
The color of the plots can be changed using the COLOR parameter.  See
the help for COLOR.

By default, the raw data from the image memory plane is used for the
profile.  If you want to take into account the current stretch for
each plane, use the 'STRETCHED keyword.

The DN axis is normally automatically scaled so the minimum DN value
in the plot is at the bottom of the axis, and the maximum DN value is
at the top.  This gives the maximum range for the data.  You may change
this with the RANGE parameter, which is useful for comparing two profiles
or expanding a certain DN range.

The 'NOSCALE keyword also affects the DN range.  'NOSCALE causes the
scaling factors from the last JPROFILE command you issued to be used.
This affects not only the DN-axis, but also the X-axis.  Use of 'NOSCALE
and RANGE may cause clipping of your data at the edges of the plot.

Examples:

    JPROFILE			! plot profile for interactive path
    JPROFILE POINT=(1,1,256,256,256,1) ! profile of predefined path
    JPROFILE GREEN 'LAST	! use previous path, only the green plane
    JPROFILE DISPRGN=PRO2	! plot at the bottom of the screen
    JPROFILE COLOR=(MAG,YEL,CYAN) D=MYRGN ! plot in MYRGN with different colors
    JPROFILE 'STRETCH		! profile of stretched data
    JPROFILE 'RTOP		! rotated profile above the path
    JPROFILE 'RT 'L 'ST C=(M,Y,C) ! using same path, plot rotated profile of
				  the stretched data, using different colors,
				  overlaid on the previous plot
    JPROFILE 'RBOT 'L		! rotated profile below the same path
    JPROFILE 'RTOP PO=(1,1,256,256,1,256) ! ***ERROR*** since rotated profiles
				  can only have one line segment
    JPROFILE 'RTOP PO=(1,1,256,256) ! this is ok

.vari planes
The PLANES parameter lists the image planes to be used for the profiles.
Any number of planes may be specified.  Each plane gets its own profile
in the display area.  The default is IMAGE, which means one profile
is plotted in black and white mode, and three profiles are plotted in
color mode (one each for the red, green, and blue planes).

Any valid plane names or numbers may be given, such as RED, GREEN, BLUE,
COLOR, GRAPHICS, or VISIBLE.  See HELP PLANENAMES for details.
.vari points
The POINTS parameter is used to specify the path over which the profile
is taken.  The points are given in terms of graphics plane coordinates.
If no points are given by the POINTS parameter, you must trace out the
path interactively on the display device.

POINTS specifies the list of points defining the vertices of the polygon
that defines the path, points=(l1,s1,l2,s2,...,ln,sn).  Each point on the
list will be connected to the next point on the list, with the last point,
(ln,sn), being unconnected.  The path is not closed, unlike a polygonal
region.

If 'LAST is specified, the path used is the same path used with the
previous JPROFILE command.  In this case, the POINTS parameter is
ignored.
.vari disprgn
DISPRGN specifies the area on the screen in which the profiles are
plotted.  Any rectangular region may be used to display the profiles,
which are scaled to fit in the region.  If a non-rectangular region
is given, the bounding rectangle is used.  Regions are defined using
JDEF-REGION.  The profile for all the planes is displayed in the same
region.

There are two pre-defined regions you can use with JPROFILE.  They
are PRO1 and PRO2.  PRO1 is centered in the top half of the screen,
and PRO2 is centered in the bottom half.  You may, of course, use your
own regions, or even redefine PRO1 and PRO2.  They are provided merely
as a convenience.  The default if no region is given is PRO1.

If either 'RTOP or 'RBOTTOM is given to make a "rotated" profile,
then DISPRGN is ignored.  See the ROTATE parameter for more details
on 'RTOP and 'RBOTTOM.
.vari color
COLOR specifies the graphics colors to use in plotting each profile.
COLOR only controls the actual data plot; the axis, labeling, path,
and markers are always plotted in WHITE.  The valid colors are:
RED, GREEN, BLUE, WHITE, CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW, and BLACK.

Each individual plane uses its own display color.  That means if you give,
for example, COLOR as a plane name, it will actually take three display
colors, since COLOR is a collection of the red, green, and blue planes.

If you don't give enough colors for all the planes, then the last color
you give will be used for all the other planes.  This allows you to say,
for example, COLOR=BLACK and have all the profiles plotted in black.
.page
If you don't specify any colors, defaults will be assigned.  If the plane
is the current red plane, the color RED will be used.  Likewise, the green
plane will use GREEN and the blue plane will use BLUE.  The bw plane uses
RED.  If the plane is not one of those four, then the color used cycles
between MAGENTA, YELLOW, and CYAN.
.vari stretch
STRETCH controls whether or not to use the look-up table (LUT) for the
planes.  If 'NOSTRETCHED is given, the raw data from the image memory is
used.  If 'STRETCHED is given, the raw data is passed through the LUT
before being plotted.  This allows you to see the effect of your contrast
enhancement on the data.
.vari range
RANGE defines the minimum and maximum DN values to use in the profile
plot.  For example, RANGE=(100,150) would make the bottom of the DN
axis have the value 100, and the top of the axis have 150.  Any DN
values outside of the range are clipped to the minimum or maximum
value.

If RANGE is not given, then the range is automatically set to the
minimum and maximum DN values in the data.  So, normally, you can
default this parameter.  RANGE is mainly used for comparing two
profiles, or for expanding a range of interest so it can be seen better.

The RANGE parameter overrides the 'NOSCALE keyword for the DN axis.
.vari scale
SCALE controls the automatic scaling of the profile plot.

If 'SCALE is given (the default), then the range of the DN axis is
automatically set to the minimum and maximum values in the data (unless
the RANGE parameter is given), and the X-axis (horizontal) scale is
set to the profile with the most points.  This lets you see the profile
the best, with minimal loss of precision.

If 'NOSCALE is given, then the scale is not re-computed for this particular
profile.  The scale from the previous JPROFILE command is used instead.
This can cause clipping of the data.  'NOSCALE is used in comparing two
or more profiles.  The RANGE parameter will override 'NOSCALE in the DN
axis, but the X-axis will still be set to the previous command's scale.
When comparing two profiles like this, you should use the same, or at least
the same-sized, display region.  If you don't, the plots will be sized
differently despite the 'NOSCALE keyword.
.vari last
If 'LAST is given, then the profile path from the previous JPROFILE
command is used.  This is useful if the screen is too cluttered to see
the profile.  Just erase the graphics plane (or any part of it, such
as your display region), and re-issue the JPROFILE command with the
'LAST parameter.  It is also useful to see the same profile before
and after a stretch.

If 'NEW is given instead (the default), then a new profile path is
used, either from the POINTS parameter (if given) or interactively
using the cursor.
.vari rotate
ROTATE allows you to make a 'rotated' profile.  This means that the
X-axis, instead of being horizontal, is coincident with the profile
path.  The DN axis is perpendicular to the profile path, and the
entire plot is rotated to the angle of the path line.  This allows
easy matches to be made between features on the image and the
profile at that same point, since each point on the profile is
directly above its location in the image.

There are some restrictions on rotated profiles.  Most important is
that there must be only one line segment in the profile path.  If you
want a profile of a complex path, the profile cannot be rotated.
Also, there is no control on the height of the profile; it is set to
half the length.
.page
You have two choices for where to put the plot.  'RTOP means that the
data goes above the line, regardless of its orientation.  This is the
method you will normally choose.  However, if the data goes off the top
of the screen, you may want to use 'RBOTTOM instead.  This causes the
data to go below the line instead of above it.

The DISPRGN parameter is ignored if 'RTOP or 'RBOTTOM is given.
The X-axis scaling from 'NOSCALE is also ignored, but the DN-axis
scaling from either 'NOSCALE or RANGE are used.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
