VIDS command JPSEDIT
.help
JPSEDIT allows you to change the pseudocolor table for the current BW
plane.  Each plane has its own copy of the pseudocolor table, so
editing the table will not affect any other planes.

Two things are needed to edit the table:  The range of values to
change, and the color to change the range to.  Both can be entered
either via parameters, or interactively using the cursor.
.page
Range Selection
---------------
The range is entered via the RANGE parameter.  If given, the two
values and all values in between are changed to the new color.
Note that these values are direct indices into the pseudocolor
table in the range 0..255; the contrast stretch is NOT applied.
A single value can be changed by giving only one number.

If RANGE is not given, the range is gathered interactively.
Two points are required to define the endpoints of the range.
These points are gathered via the cursor.  The pixel value
underneath the cursor when button 1 is pressed is used as the
endpoints of the range.  The values under the cursor are sent
through the contrast stretch lookup table before use, so the
actual color you see on the screen is the color that gets modified.
.page
The first point is selected with button 1.  After that, you get
a rubber-band line following the cursor to let you know where
the first point was.  Press the button again for the other point
in the range.  Note that the pixels in between the two points
on the screen are not relevant - just the values at the endpoints.
The pixel values in between those two values are changed, regardless
of where they happen to be on the screen.

A color wedge is drawn in the RREGION display region unless the
'NOIMAGE keyword is given.  This allows you to see the entire
pseudocolor table at once.  The endpoints may be selected either
from the wedge or from the image.  If the wedge is drawn, the image
underneath the wedge is saved and restored to the screen after the
selection.
.page
Once you select a pair of points, the color picker comes up unless
you gave a color on the command line.  After that, the range of values
gets set to the color chosen, and you can select another range.  Button 2
cancels and restores the table to where it started.  Button 3 terminates
and accepts the edited table.
.page
Color Selection
---------------

The color is entered via either the RGB or the COLOR parameter.
If both are given, RGB overrides.  RGB is used to specify a
color triplet, that is, the red, green, and blue intensities
of the color (in that order).  The numbers are all in the range
0..255.  The COLOR keyword parameter can be used to select one
of a number of predefined colors.  The allowed colors are
RED, GREEN, BLUE, ORANGE, YELLOW, MAGENTA, CYAN, PURPLE, BROWN,
PINK, LTGREEN, LTBLUE, VIOLET, GREY, BLACK, WHITE, AQUA, and MELON.
.page
If neither RGB nor COLOR are given, the color is defined interactively.
The colors are defined using the HSV color model, for Hue, Saturation,
and Value (or brightness).  There are two sections to the color picker.
The top is a hexagon used to select the hue and saturation.  The hexagon
can also be thought of as a cube.  Hue is determined by the angle the
cursor makes with the center of the hexagon.  Saturation is determined
by the radial distance from the cursor to the center of the hexagon.
The bottom part of the color picker is the intensity (or brightness
or value) scale.  The horizontal position of the cursor on the scale
determines the intensity.

Initially, the cursor starts in the brightness scale.  Pressing button 1
toggles the cursor between the brightness scale and the color hexagon.
Button 3 accepts the current color and exits the color picker.  Button 2
cancels the operation.  In either case, if you are also interactively
selecting the range, you can then select another range.  If you gave the
range on the command line, then the JPSEDIT command is exited.
.page
If 'NOIMAGE is selected, then the outline of the hexagon and brightness
scale are drawn in the graphics plane using the CREGION display region.
The selected range of colors on the screen will change as the cursor
moves to indicate the current color.

If 'IMAGE is selected (the default), then the color hexagon and brightness
scale are drawn in the image planes in the CREGION display region, allowing
you to see the entire range of available colors.  As you move the cursor
in the brightness scale, the color hexagon is updated to show the available
colors at that brightness.  Likewise, as the cursor is moved in the color
hexagon, the brightness scale is updated to show all the brightness levels
of that color.  The image under the display region is saved and restored
later.  The background of the display region shows the currently selected
color.  Due to limitations in the hardware, the image outside the display
region will look strange as the hardware lookup tables are manipulated.
It will be restored when you are done with the color picker.
.page
The 'LABEL keyword parameter will continuously draw the current red, green,
and blue values in the graphics plane.  This works whether or not 'IMAGE
is used.

Examples:

JPSEDIT (120,140) (50,100,150)	! sets the range (120,140) to the color
				! red=50, green=100, blue=150
JPSEDIT (0,10) 'YELLOW		! sets the range (0,10) to yellow
JPSEDIT 50			! sets color 50 interactively
JPSEDIT 'BROWN			! sets interactively defined ranges to brown
JPSEDIT				! interactively select both range and color
JPSEDIT (10,20) CREG=A 'LABEL	! color picker uses region A, and plots labels
JPSEDIT 'NOIMAGE		! interactive without disturbing the image
.level1
.vari range
Range of values to change.
Interactive if not given.
.vari rgb
RGB color value to use.
Overrides COLOR.
Interactive if not given.
.vari rregion
Display region for range
selection.
.vari cregion
Display region for color picker.
.vari color
Color to use.  Overridden by
RGB.  Interactive if not given.
.vari image
Controls writing in the image
planes.
.vari labels
Controls current RGB value
labels.
.vari device
Name of device to use
.level2
.vari range
RANGE selects the range of DN values to change.  If two numbers are
given, those values and all values in between are changed.  If only
one number is given, only one DN value is changed.

If RANGE is not given, then the range is defined interactively.  See
the main help for JPSEDIT.
.vari rgb
RGB defines the color to use as Red, Green, and Blue intensities in
that order.  The intensities range from 0 to 255.  All three values
must be given if any are given.

RGB will override the COLOR parameter.  If neither are given, the color
is defined interactively.  See the main help for JPSEDIT.
.vari rregion
RREGION defines the display region for the interactive range selection.
It is not used if the RANGE parameter is given.  It is also not used
if 'NOIMAGE is specified, as the range wedge is not drawn in that case.

The default for RREGION is the predefined region "WEDGE", which is also
used for the JWEDGE command.  You may redefine "WEDGE" to change the
default position using JDEF-REGION if you wish.
.vari cregion
CREGION defines the display region for the interactive color selection.
It is not used if the RGB or COLOR parameters are given.

The default for CREGION is the predefined region "COLORPICK". You
may redefine "COLORPICK" to change the default position using
JDEF-REGION if you wish.
.vari color
The COLOR keyword parameter specifies which of several predefined colors
to use.  The available colors are:

RED, GREEN, BLUE, ORANGE, YELLOW, MAGENTA, CYAN, PURPLE, BROWN,
PINK, LTGREEN, LTBLUE, VIOLET, GREY, BLACK, WHITE, AQUA, MELON

The COLOR parameter is overridden by RGB.  If neither are given, the
color is defined interactively.  See the main help for JPSEDIT.
.vari image
IMAGE controls whether or not to use the image planes during interactive
operations.  It is ignored if there are no interactive operations.
'IMAGE (the default) will allow things to be drawn in the image planes
to help you with interactive range and color selection.  The image that
is written over is saved in memory and restored upon exit.  'NOIMAGE
prevents the image planes from being written on.  The color picker
uses only the graphics plane in this case; while the range selector
doesn't draw anything.

Using the color picker with 'IMAGE will cause the image outside the
color picker area to look strange, due to manipulations of the hardware
lookup tables.  It will be restored upon exit.
.vari labels
LABEL selects whether or not to continuously draw the current red, green,
and blue value numbers in the graphics plane while using the color picker.
It is ignored if the color picker is not used.  It works whether or not
'IMAGE is specified.

LABEL normally defaults to 'NOLABEL, which does not draw the labels.
This is because using 'LABEL will slow down the interactive response
somewhat.

If 'LABEL is on, the current red, green, and blue values are printed
in the corners of the color hexagon in their respective colors.  Red is
in the upper right, green is in the upper left, and blue is in the
bottom left.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
