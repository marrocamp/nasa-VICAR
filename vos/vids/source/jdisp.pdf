VIDS command JDISP
.help
JDISP will perform a quick display of an image.  As the name implies,
it will only load images into the visible planes.  If one band is to
be displayed, the display device is put into black and white mode,
otherwise it is put into color mode.  If any scaling has been specified
for an image (via the JSET-RANGE command), then the scaling will be used
on each pixel.  If any configuration other than the available
configurations for JDISP are desired, then the JLOAD-IMAGE command should
be used to load image planes independently.

See the examples on the following page.
.page
Examples:

JDISP A.IMG	- Display the image file A.IMG
JDISP 'FIT	- Redisplay A.IMG zoomed to fit on the screen
JDISP A.IMG 100 100 200 200 (50,50)
		- Display the 200 x 200 pixel area of the file A.IMG 
		- starting at (100,100) in the file, with the upper left
		- corner located at (50,50) on the image plane.
JDISP LOC=(400,400) 'FIT
		- Redisplay A.IMG so that the entire image fits between
		- (400,400) on the image plane and the bottom right corner.

.vari inp
The INP parameter is used to specify an input image or images.  If
omitted, each visible image plane will be refreshed from the last
image displayed in it.  A single input file with one band will result
in a black and white display.  Multiple input files or a single input
file with multiple bands will result in a color display.  The bands
displayed are as follows:

	o For one input file, if NB > 1, the first 3 bands are displayed
	  as red, green, and blue, respectively.  If NB=2, the first 2
	  bands are displayed as red and green, respectively.
	o For three input files, the first band of each will be displayed
	  as red, green, and blue, respectively.
	o For two input files, the first band of each file will be
	  displayed as red and green, respectively.  If the second file
	  has more than one band, the second band will be displayed as blue.
.vari sl
The SL, SS, NL, and NS parameters are integer parameters used to define
the portion of the input images to be displayed.  They specify the
starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.
.vari ss
The SL, SS, NL, and NS parameters are integer parameters used to define
the portion of the input images to be displayed.  They specify the
starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.
.vari nl
The SL, SS, NL, and NS parameters are integer parameters used to define
the portion of the input images to be displayed.  They specify the
starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.
.vari ns
The SL, SS, NL, and NS parameters are integer parameters used to define
the portion of the input images to be displayed.  They specify the
starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.
.vari location
The LOCATION parameter is an integer parameter used to specify the
location on the display device at which the upper left corner of the
image should be displayed.  For example, to display a 256 line by 256
sample image in the bottom right corner of a 512 by 512 pixel display,
"LOCATION=(257,257)" could be specified.
.vari zoom
The ZOOM parameter specifies a software zoom factor to be used when
displaying the image.  The requested zoom factor is always used, and
thus overrides the SCALE parameter if it is given.  See also the
JZOOM command.
.vari scale
The SCALE parameter is a keyword parameter, and may have either of two
values: FIT or NONE.  If SCALE=FIT, then the image is scaled so that
the entire image will fit on the display device.  If SCALE=NONE
(the default), then only the portion of the image starting at (SL,SS)
which will fit on the display device without scaling is displayed.

Note that if the ZOOM parameter is specified, SCALE is ignored.
.vari device
The DEVICE parameter specifies which display device to perform this
operation on.  This device will then become the current device for
future operations.

If DEVICE is not given, the current display device is used, i.e. the
last device you specified on any VIDS command.

A device must be JGRAB'ed before use.  See the help for JGRAB for more
details.
