<title>JADE Utility Classes</title>

<body>
Package containing all of the utility classes for JADE.  Although these
classes are public and can be used if desired, they are intended to be
for internal use of the JADE components.  If you use code in here, you're
probably doing something weird.  See the <code>jpl.mipl.jade</code>
package for the normal user-accessible components.
