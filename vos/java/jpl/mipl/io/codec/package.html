VICAR Image I/O Codec package for JAI.  Input and output are supported.  
The Vicar I/O classes are called to do I/O. <br>
The package includes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>High-level JAI input codec with arbitrary tiling
<li>High-level JAI output codec with arbitrary tiling
<li>Thread-safe
<li>1 banded images are treated as Gray scale
<li>3 banded images are treated as RGB
<li>A JAI RenderedImage from any input file format may be saved as a VICAR file
<li>A vicar label created for images which were not input as vicar files
<li>Binary labels supported (although discouraged)
<li>Codec supports label access via JAI properties
</ul>

The codec is auto-registered with JAI (via the <code>OperationRegistrySpi</code>
mechanism), so user code does not have to do anything to register it.  Simply
attempt to open a vicar file, or save in "<code>vicar</code>" format.
