VICAR Image I/O package.  Currently only Input and Output are supported;
in-place Update of files is not.  The package's major features are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Full label parsing
<li>Low-level (record-based) I/O API
<li>Mid-level (tile-based) I/O API
<li>Thread-safe
<li>Data type translation for any valid VICAR file
<li>Binary label supported (although discouraged)
</ul>
Note that Complex data is not fully supported.
<p>
While direct access to VICAR files via this API is possible, it is recommended
that the higher-level "codec" from the <code>jpl.mipl.io.codec</code> package
be used instead.  This codec is automatically registered with JAI using the
<code>OperationRegistrySpi</code> interface.  The codec supports tiling and
access to the VICAR metadata.
<p>
Information on the mid- and low-level interfaces can be found in the javadoc
for the <code>VicarInput</code> and <code>VicarOutput</code> interfaces.
<p>
Support files for the PDS and ISIS image formats have been added. These classes are
used by the PDS reader and writer. ISIS has a reader only.
