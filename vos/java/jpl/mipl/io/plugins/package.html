VICAR Image I/O package. This package supplies plugins for reading and
writing
images using the ImageIO package which is part of &nbsp;the standard
Java
system JDK1.4 and higher. The plugins are automatically registered. The
plugins
are independent of JAI. A RenderedImage is returned from a reader. A
RenderedImage
from any source may be given to a writer. <br>
SUN supplies some standard Readers and Writers. Some of them are
curretnly
supplied as a part of the standard JDK package (jpg, png, gif). A few
others
will be supplied with the JAI package. Tiff, pnm, bmp are planned.. <br>
This package supplies plugins for some image formats not supported by
the
standard or JAI plugin set.<br>
Currently Readers and Writers for Vicar and PDS images are included. <br>
The plugins use the vicar I/O classes to perform low level file access.<br>
The ImageIO package adds support for image metadata. Vicar and PDS
labels
are the metadata source. <br>
A Transcoder layer allows the conversion of metadata from one format to
the
form understood by a different format. A specific transcoder must be
written
to handle transcoding metadata from one specific format to another.<br>
&nbsp;The current package contains a Vicar to PDS transcoder. <br>
The Transcoder use an XSL script to control the conversion processing.<br>
<br>
In the simplest form the following code can be used to read in an image
file
and write it out as jpeg image file. ImageIO will ask each registered
plugin
if it can read the file. If one of the plugins says "Yes" it will be
asked
to open the file and return the RenderedImage. A RenderedImage can then
be
used by a program to display the image or it can be used to obtain the
data
contained in the image file. In the example below the RenderedImage is
supplied
to the writer. There must be a writer available for the requested
format.<br>
<br>
<b>String input_file = "mer_edr.vic";<br>
String output_format &nbsp;= "jpg";<br>
String output_file = mer_edr.jpg";<br>
RenderedImage image&nbsp; image = ImageIO.read(new File(input_file));<br>
ImageIO.write(image, output_format, output_file);</b><br>
<br>
Currently Input, Output and Transcoding are supported.<br>
&nbsp;In-place Update of files is not. <br>
The package's major features are:
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Full label parsing</li>
  <li>Low-level (record-based) I/O API</li>
  <li>Mid-level (tile-based) I/O API</li>
  <li>Thread-safe</li>
  <li>Data type translation for any valid VICAR or PDS file</li>
  <li>Reading and writing "Dual Labeled" PDS files. A PDS label with an
embedded
vicar label.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Binary label supported (although discouraged)</li>
  <li>Transcoding of metadata. Vicar to PDS is the only currently
available
Transcoder.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Note that Complex data is not fully supported.
<p>While direct access to VICAR and PDS files via this API is possible,
it
is recommended that the higher-level "plugin" from the <code>jpl.mipl.io.plugins</code>
package be used instead. This plugin is automatically registered . The
plugin supports tiling and access to the VICAR or PDS metadata.</p>
<p>Information on the mid- and low-level interfaces can be found in the
javadoc
for the <code>VicarInput</code> and <code>VicarOutput</code>
interfaces.<br>
</p>
<p>To write a vicar format image file the format String should be
"vicar".<br>
</p>
<p>To write a vicar format image file the format String should be "pds".<br>
</p>
<p>Eventually JAI codec's will be deprecated.<br>
</p>
<p>Added functionality 4-2003<br>
An ISIS (USGS Flagstaff) image reader has been added.<br>
Vicar, PDS and ISIS readers can now return a RenderedImage. Previously
the returned image was actually
a BufferedImage. A BufferedImage is displayable since it includes a
ColorModel. If the Jade display component is used a RenderedImage may
be used and the Jade component will add a suitable
ColorModel.<br>
Requesting a RenderedImage has 2 valuable uses. <br>
1). A RenderedImage can contain more than 3 bands. 3 bands must be
selected from these to create something
which can be displayed.<br>
2). A RenderedImage doesn't pull data until it is requested thus saving
some overhead when a subset of the image is all that is required, such
as in a display of a large image using the Jade component.<br>
</p>
<p>Added 5-26-2005<br>
A FITS reader has been added. It uses the nom.tam.fits libraries
written by Thomas McGlynn of Goddard.<br>
