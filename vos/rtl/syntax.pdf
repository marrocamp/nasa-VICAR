 Vicar procedure SYNTAX
.help
 PURPOSE:
 SYNTAX is a procedure that allows syntax checking of programs run
 under VICAR. This is particularly useful for programs to be run in batch
 mode.

 OPERATION:

 SYNTAX sets a switch which prevents a Vicar program from executing after
 it is invoked. However all normal processing up to actual program 
 execution does take place, so any syntax errors or parameters errors
 that are visible to VICAR will be detected and reported.

 Type:

 VICAR> SYNTAX CHECK

 to set the switch. Thereafter, all programs executed interactively or in
 batch mode in  the same VICAR session will operate under the "syntax-checking"
 mode.  This command is equivalent to the command "FLAG-SET SYNTAX".

 To turn the switch off, type:

 VICAR> SYNTAX NOCHECK

 This command is equivalent to "FLAG-DEL SYNTAX".

 Caution: The command "LET $SWITCH=..." should not be used in syntax
 mode, since the syntax check flag is in $SWITCH.  By setting $SWITCH
 to an absolute value, it is possible to  turn off syntax check mode
 by accident.  To set of clear other options in $SWITCH, use the 
 FLAG-ADD or FLAG-DEL command.
.level1
.vari mode
 Syntax checking mode.
 Valid: CHECK, NOCHECK.
.level2
.vari mode
 If CHECK is specified, then the syntax-checking mode is invoked and any
 Vicar programs run thereafter will not execute. However, any syntax
 or parameter errors will be reported to the user.

 If NOCHECK is specified, then the syntax-checking mode is turned off and
 Vicar programs will execute normally.
