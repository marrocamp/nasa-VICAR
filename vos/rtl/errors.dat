routines, or in the input label.

User action:

Verify that the input file has a valid value for INTFMT and BINTFMT.
If the problem is not obvious, consult the cognizant programmer.

Programmer action:

Check that all INTFMT and BINTFMT values are valid.  Currently, the valid
values are ``LOW'' and ``HIGH''.  If you are working on a machine with a
different integer representation, please consult the VICAR executive
programmer about adding it to the system.

%%KEY BADOPR
%%NUMBER -33
%%NAME IMPROPER_OPERATION
%%MESSAGE Operation conflicts with open attributes; program error
%%HELP
Explanation:

Improper operation.  The program tried to perform an operation
on the indicated file which is forbidden in the mode in which
the file has been opened.  For instance, trying to write to a

history subsets, denoted by the TASK keyword.  This situation
is usually caused by the user deleting the history label.

User action:

Use the program LABEL or the DCL DUMP facility to examine the
label of the image file in question.  If the label contains
any non-empty TASK keywords, there is probably an executive
bug, so consult the system programmer.  If not, and a history
label is desired, use LABEL-REMOVE to remove the system
label, and LABEL-CREATE to create a new one.

BAND, or SAMP optional arguments, is only partially specified.  This
condition arises when an image file has a third dimension which is
greater than one unit in size (for example, a band-sequential image
with more than one band), and the starting value in either the second
or third dimension was defaulted (for example, you have a band-sequential
image and you specify BAND but not LINE).  The error condition was
raised because the record being requested is ambiguous.

User Action:

This is a program error.  Notify the cognizant programmer.

Programmer Action:

Either completely specify the record in the call to XVREAD or XVWRIT
(for band-sequential images, give both LINE and BAND), or completely
default it (give neither).

%%KEY NOSCHTSK
%%NUMBER -44
%%NAME NO_SUCH_TASK
%%MESSAGE No such task in label
%%HELP
Explanation:

The requested task was not in the history label of the image file.

of VICAR being used to read the file.  If the same version is
being used for creating and reading the PARMS file, and the error
still occurs, then consult the VICAR executive programmer.

%%KEY TOOLATE
%%NUMBER -63
%%NAME TOO_LATE
%%MESSAGE Attempt to modify tape label after write; program error
%%HELP
Explanation:

Occurs when label processing to a tape file is attempted after
the first I/O to that file.  Due to the sequential nature of the
tape device, once a record is read or written to a tape file, the
labels may not be read or modified.

User action:

Program may require file to be on disk.  Write desired file to disk.
If the problem is still not obvious consult the cognizant programmer.

%%KEY NOLAB

Explanation:

An attempt has been made to add a label item with the label routine
XLADD, mode ``ADD'', for a key that already exists.  A duplicate
item cannot be added under the same HISTORY subset, the same PROPERTY
subset, or the SYSTEM label.  To modify an existing item, use XLADD
with mode ``REPLACE''.

User action:

If the item is user specified a new subset must be created to
accept the item, or the label item must be replaced instead of
added.  If the item is not user specified and this message is
displayed, consult the cognizant programmer.

%%KEY BADBINSIZ
%%NUMBER -66
%%NAME IMPROPER_BINARY_SIZE_PARAM
%%MESSAGE Improper binary size parameter; program error

%%KEY NOTMULT
%%NUMBER -74
%%NAME BUF_NOT_MULT_OF_REC
%%MESSAGE Tape blocksize is not an integral number of records
%%HELP
Explanation:

For a tape which is being blocked, the block size for the tape (usually
given by BLOCKING in the mount command) is not an integral number of records.
This case is not allowed because it makes reading the tape difficult and puts
data in a non-standard format.  A second possibility is that the record size
is greater than 65,534 bytes.  If this is the case, you must default the
block size on the mount, and you must not use the NOBLOCK option in the
XVOPEN call, or you will get this error.

User action:

Verify that block size you gave on the MOUNT command is an integral number
of records.  The record size for a band-sequential (BSQ) or band-interleaved
by line (BIL) image is NS * (bytes per pixel), and for a band interleaved by
pixel (BIP) image is NB * (bytes per pixel).  If your record size is greater
than 65,534 bytes, then do not specify the block size on the MOUNT command,
and do not use the NOBLOCK option from XVOPEN.

%%KEY ENDOFVOL

User action:

Use a different version of VICAR that is built with tape support,
if available.  If not, consult your system manager about rebuilding
the RTL with tape support, if tape drives are available on the
system being used.  Note that use of tapes requires the use of TAE.

%%KEY NOTPARMFILE
%%NUMBER -77
%%NAME NOT_PARAMETER_FILE
%%MESSAGE File specified in PARMS is not a parameter file
%%HELP
Explanation:

The file given with PARMS must be a parameter file created by
another program with XVPOPEN, XVPOUT, etc., and not an image file.

User action:

Check that the filename you gave is correct.  If it is, then
consult the cognizant programmer for the program that created the file.

Programmer action:

Parameter files must be created using XVPOPEN, XVPOUT,
and XVPCLOSE, and must have a file type of ``PARAM'', ``PARM'',
or ``PARMS''.  Normal image files cannot be used as parameter files.

%%KEY MULTPARMFILE
