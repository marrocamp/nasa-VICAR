 *	Note on UNIX Event Package:  the event package does not really
 *	exist under the UNIX implementation of TAE.  The only real
 *	need for events is the process control function ("process")
 *	and this has been coded with UNIX-specific logic, avoiding the
 *	event package.  The terminal package does support t_attn 
 * 	and e_occur for operator attention.

 *
 *	ecb structure
 *
 *	An ecb is the event control block.  It contains data 
 *	necessary for use of the event package.  The contents of the ecb
 *	are, by convention, hidden from the user.
