The MAP PROJECTION section contains those programs which allow the user to 
project an image in a specific map projection, or allow the user to change 
the map projection to another type. These programs include:

MAP2                MAPTRANS            POLARECT            POLYMAP
POLYPMAP            PTP                 RING
