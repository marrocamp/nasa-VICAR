.Proc POLYMASK
[1mPOLYMASK[0m  - Cuts the portion of an image delineated by a set of
            polygons contained in a Graphics-1 file, setting the data on 
            the inside or outside of the polygons to a specified DN level.
.Proc POLYPMAP
[1mPOLYPMAP[0m  - Performs planet-wide map projections on Graphics-1 files, 
            between latitude/longitude space and line/sample space.
.Proc POLYREG
[1mPOLYREG[0m   - Rigidly transforms polygon dataset to correct for 
            differences in size, rotation, aspect or skew.
.Proc RAPIDMOS
[1mRAPIDMOS[0m  - Mosaics up to 40 byte images into one image.  Similar to
            FASTMOS but with reduced functionality.
.Proc TIECONM
[1mTIECONM[0m   - Prepares a gridded dataset for POLYGEOM, GEOMA, LGEOM,
            MGEOM or GEOMZ transformations using paired sets of tiepoints,
            applying the finite element method (triangulation) for surface 
            fitting.
