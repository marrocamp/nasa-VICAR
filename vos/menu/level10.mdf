The Image Based Information System (IBIS) is a raster geographic information 
system (GIS) which is designed to: accept large volumes of spacial data, 
derived from a variety of sources, including remote sensors, and to 
efficiently store, retrieve, manipulate, analyze, and display these data 
according to user-defined specifications.

IBIS is a functional subset of VICAR that uses the VICAR labels and image 
files, but also uses two primary and two special purpose file types and 
structures.

PRIMARY FILE TYPES:                         SPECIAL PURPOSE FILE TYPES

A) Interface (attribute-tabular) file       a) Graphics-2 (GR-2) file
b) Graphics-1 (GR-1) file                   b) Graphics-3 (GR-3) file
.page
          The INTERFACE (ATTRIBUTE-TABULAR) FILE

1) A file structure for the storage and manipulation of any data that can 
   be represented in a "table-like" format.

2) Data are stored in a "Rows and Columns" configuration.
   a) Rows typically represent discrete items (or regions).
   b) Columns typically contain attribute data describing each item (or 
      region).

3) Numeric data stored in REAL4 format.

4) Character data stored in A4 format.

       The GRAPHICS-1 (GR-1) FILE

1) A file structure for the storage and manipulation of any data that can 
   be represented in a sequential "line string-like" format.

2) EXAMPLE:

   X,Y,Z,label,0.,0.,X,Y,Z,label, 0.,0.,...    or
   L,S,L,S,L,S,L,S,0.,0.,L,S,L,S,L,S,0.,0.,...

3) Numeric data stored in REAL4 format.

4) Character data stored in A4 format.

                3) REGISTRATION, MOSAICKING and MAP PROJECTIONS
                4) FILE TRANSFER and UTILITIES
                5) DATA INSPECTION and DISPLAY
                6) DIGITAL TERRAIN PROCESSING

                3) TIEPOINT/COREGISTRATION
                4) MAP PROJECTIONS
                5) MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
