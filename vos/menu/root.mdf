.HELP
Welcome to the VICAR Menu System.  This menu system was created in order to 
meet two objectives. First, to assist the new VICAR user in locating 
appropriate programs and second, to act as a reference for the advanced user.

When a new user is faced with the multitude of the VICAR application programs,
it is very easy to become disoriented and frustrated trying to locate that one 
unknown program that will accomplish the desired task. The VICAR Menu has
been designed so that the new user will be guided through a series of menu
screens in order to easily locate the desired program.
.page
Once the user has located the desired program, you need only select the
program and you are automatically put into Tutor mode.  The Tutor mode
helps the user to actually execute the program.  The program parameter
names are listed and defined, and if there are default values for the 
parameters they are indicated.  

In addition, the Tutor screen also indicates the class of program.  On the 
top line of the Tutor screen, the LIBRARY of the program is indicated.  If 
the program is in either R1LIB or R2LIB, these are normal programs and they 
are fully supported and tested. The R3LIB programs are a special set of 
programs which have not been tested, they are not supported and they may 
not even have a help file associated with them. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS 
AND USE THE R3LIB PROGRAMS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
.page 
Once you have selected the appropriate parameters, Tutor will execute the 
program when you enter the command RUN.  Once the program has been executed, 
the user is returned to the menu.  The user can then locate the next program 
they wish to execute or exit from the menu.

                           HELP INFORMATION




In order to learn how to use the menu system, please type HELP when you are 
in the menu. This command will put you in the help mode which then defines:
how to use the menu, what the commands mean, and how to obtain 
additional help information at each level of the menu.

             SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT USING THE VICAR MENU



1) The Menu System is composed of a series of menu screens. The initial 
   screen displayed when the menu system is first entered is called the 
   Root Menu screen.  The Menu system then proceeds through a series of 
   lower level screens.

2) In the upper right corner of each lower level menu screen, there is an 
   indication of what page you are on, and how many pages are associated with 
   that category.

             SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT USING THE VICAR MENU

3) In the lower level menu screens, the program names will be shown in 
   either BOLD/CAPITAL letters, or in non-bold/small letters. The 
   bold/capital letters indicate that this category is a primary usage of 
   that program. The non-bold/small letters indicate that the program 
   accomplishes the task defined in the category, but that this task is 
   not the primary usage of the program. 

   USERS ARE ADVISED TO SCAN THE BOLD/CAPITAL PROGRAMS FIRST SINCE A 
   MAJORITY OF THE TIME THE PROGRAM YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WILL BE IN THE 
   BOLD/CAPITAL CLASSIFICATION.

4) Programs may be located under several categories. Since most programs 
   can accomplish more than one function, the programs will be listed  
   under several menu categories.

The Root Menu (or the top level menu screen) has been divided into 3 main 
categories: VICAR Help Information, Image Processing Selections and Special 
Processing.

help information available.

          2)  NEW VICAR USER TUTORIAL
          3)  VICAR SAMPLE PROCEDURES

The new user is advised to make use of the tools available within the
VICAR Help Information section.

reading). If this is the first time you have used the menu, please take the 
time to finish reading this section.

teaches the new user about VICAR.  If you are a new user, or if you would

this level of the menu.  The exact same tutorial may also be accessed 
outside of the menu by typing NUT at the VICAR prompt.
