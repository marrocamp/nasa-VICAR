  The heart of the Geographic Information System (GIS) is the ability to  
overlay two or more spatial map datasets (images) and determine the 
intersection of map features.  This is referred to as "Polygon Overlay", 
because the two spatial datasets usually contain some closed polygonal-like 
features (i.e., regions of similar pixel DNs such as a classification map). 
Typically, one of the (image) spatial maps to be overlayed is a 
"Georeference", containing pixel polygons conforming to some desired 
administrative boundary system (e.g., counties; census tracts; managerial 
districts; simple grid reference; etc.). The polygon overlay of a 
classification map with a simple CELLGEN-generated georeference would 
produce an IBIS tabular file of three columns, where Column 1 would contain 
the CELLGEN region DN; Column 2 would contain all the unique classification 
DNs occurring in each CELLGEN region; and Column 3 would be the count of 
Column 2 classification pixels in each CELLGEN region.  Various IBIS 
utility programs allow the three column tabular file to be manipulated 
(summed, aggregated, enlarged, converted and printed).

   To support polygon overlay, additional IBIS tiepoint and map projection 
software allow the development of multilayered spatial dataplanes (images) 
that are co-registered to each other for proper polygon overlay between 
themselves and with the georeference.  Other IBIS software permits 
multivariate analysis, map and graphics data display, and tabular 
reporting.  The ability to enter any kind of tabular data into an IBIS file 
permits the use of IBIS coregistration, analysis, and display software for 
any application, regardless of whether polygon overlay or a georeference is 
involved or not.
