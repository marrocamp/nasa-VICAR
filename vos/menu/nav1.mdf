.Proc NAV 
[1mNAV[0m     - Determines interactively the camera viewing geometry of
          an image by locating one or more distinct features in the image
          (e.g., planet limb).
.Proc NAV2
[1mNAV2[0m    - Determines interactively the camera viewing geometry of
          an image by registering it to a reference image whose viewing
          geometry is known.
.Proc NEARENC
[1mNEARENC[0m - Determines non-interactively the camera viewing geometry
          of an image by registering it to a reference image whose viewing
          geometry is known.

The PLANETARY NAVIGATION section contains those programs which allow the 
user to determine the camera viewing geometry which is used to transform 
images from picture coordinates to planetary coordinates. These programs 
include:

amos                FARENC              map2                NAV
NAV2                NEARENC
