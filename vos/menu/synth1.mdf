.Proc CELLGEN
[1mCELLGEN[0m  - Creates image composed of square, equal-sized regions of
           encoded DN values increasing from left to right & top to bottom.
.Proc FRACGEN
[1mFRACGEN[0m  - Generates images which are similar to elevation images of
           mountainous regions using the fractional Brownian Motion process.
.Proc GAUSNOIS
[1mGAUSNOIS[0m - Generates a random DN (noise) image using a Gaussian
           probability distribution.
.Proc GEN
[1mGEN[0m      - Generates artificial image with specified size & values.
.Proc GENTHIS
[1mGENTHIS[0m  - Generates small image given a list of DN values for each
           pixel in the image.
.Proc POLYNOIS
[1mPOLYNOIS[0m - Produces an image containing discrete level noise.
.Proc RADAGEN
[1mRADAGEN[0m  - Transforms terrain image, where DN's represent altitude,
           into a synthetic radar image. 
.Proc SPOT
[1mSPOT[0m     - Generates byte images containing spots of various 
           profiles and sizes.
.Proc TESTGEN
[1mTESTGEN[0m  - Generates 16-step grey scale for calibration of film 
           recorder. Generally used by operations staff only.
