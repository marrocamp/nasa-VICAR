[1mGEOM[0m     - Procedure automatically selecting MGEOM or LGEOM to
           perform geometric transformations.
.Proc GEOMA
[1mGEOMA[0m    - Performs geometric transformations on images using 
           quadrilaterals.

           more accurate than LGEOM for rotations of up to 85 degrees.
.Proc MZGEOM
[1mMZGEOM[0m   - Performs simultaneous geometric and brightness 
           corrections.
.Proc PICMATCH
[1mPICMATCH[0m - IBIS image correlation routine for matching images 
           or ground control point datasets to an image.

The REGISTRATION TOOLS section contains those programs which allow the user 
to register images (that is to transform an image so that it will 
correspond with another image of the same scene).  These programs include:

GEOM                GEOMA               LGEOM               MGEOM
MZGEOM              PICMATCH            PICREG              R
RG                  TOPOTRANS
