.help
JMENUSTART is a short procedure that allocates a display device (if
needed), and then starts up VIDS.  You will be asked for the device
name to use.

If VIDS is already running, then a message will be printed and the
procedure will exit.

This procedure is meant to be called from the VIDS Menu System.
It should not normally be run directly in command mode.
