The ANNOTATION section contains those programs which allow the user to 
superimpose text on or around an image. This includes adding text 
information actually within the border of the image, adding a grid around 
the outside of the image and adding label information outside of the image 
border. These programs include:

FONT               MASKV              STARLAB            TEXTAD


The DISPLAY section contains those programs which allow the user to 
display data on a monitor. A majority of the programs permit the user to 
interactively manipulate the data and redisplay the new image. These programs
include:
