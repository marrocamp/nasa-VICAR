.Proc PICREG
picreg    - Allows interactive registration of two images, generates
            the tiepoint and/or a geometric transformation file (used with
            TIECONM, GEOMA, LGEOM or MGEOM).
.Proc R
[1mR[0m         - Performs automated registration of two images that are
            similar geometrically except for offset.
.Proc RG
rg        - Converts tiepoints generated by R into GEOMA parameters
            and produces a plot of the tiepoint shift in the output
            tiepoint transformation.
.Proc STERGEN
[1mSTERGEN[0m   - Generates a correlation tiepoint file from a stereo pair
            of images, based on interactive user input.
.Proc TIECONM
tieconm   - Prepares a gridded dataset for POLYGEOM, GEOMA, LGEOM,
            MGEOM or GEOMZ transformations using paired sets of tiepoints,
            applying the finite element method (triangulation) for surface
            fitting.
