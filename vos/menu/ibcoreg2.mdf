.Proc POLYGEOM
[1mPOLYGEOM[0m  - Performs geometric transformations to correct
            for distortion.  May increase/decrease size of a point dataset
            or return it to its original size.
.Proc TIECONM
[1mTIECONM[0m   - Prepares a gridded dataset for POLYGEOM, GEOMA,
            LGEOM, MGEOM or GEOMZ transformations using paired sets of tie-
            points, applying the finite element method for surface fitting.
.Proc TIEPARM
[1mTIEPARM[0m   - Converts tiepoints from an interface file to a
            parameter file (for TIECONM) and vice versa.
.Proc TIEPLOT
[1mTIEPLOT[0m   - Plots tiepoints in an interface file by drawing
            vectors indicating direction and amount of shift between old 
            and new pixels.
