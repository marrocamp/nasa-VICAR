.Proc LGEOM
[1mLGEOM[0m     - Performs geometric transformations on images and is 
            recommended for image rotations greater than 85 degrees.
.Proc MAP2
[0mmap2[0m      - Generates map projections by rubber-sheeting methods.
.Proc MAPTRANS
[0mmaptrans[0m  - Transforms an image from one map projection to another.
.Proc MGEOM
[1mMGEOM[0m     - Performs geometric transformations on images. Faster and
            more accurate than LGEOM for rotations of up to 85 degrees.
.Proc MZGEOM
[1mMZGEOM[0m    - Performs simultaneous geometric and brightness 
            correction.
.Proc POLARECT
[1mPOLARECT[0m  - Performs rectangular/polar coordinates transformations
            (or vice versa) on an image with respect to an origin.
.Proc POLYGEOM
[1mPOLYGEOM[0m  - IBIS program performing geometric transformations to 
            correct for distortion. It may increase or decrease the size 
            of a point polygon dataset or return it to its original state.
