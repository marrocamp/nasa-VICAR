 
Instructions for Importing the SPICE Toolkit
===========================================================================
 
   This document describes how to import the SPICE TOOLKIT package on PC
   computers using LINUX operating system and GFORTRAN compiler. We
   recommend that at a minimum you look over the sections "System
   Requirements" and "Importing the SPICE TOOLKIT Package" before you begin
   importing the SPICE TOOLKIT package.
 
   We also strongly recommend that you not try to port this package to any
   other environment without first consulting NAIF. By saying "porting" we
   mean trying to build this package on a different computer hardware or
   operating system type, or using a different compiler brand or a
   different version of the compiler used to build this package, or
   changing any compile options, such as optimization level, that are used
   in the script(s) building the libraries included in this package.
   Detailed information about the system on which this package was compiled
   and tested is provided in the section "Recompiling the Toolkit" below.
 
   In addition to this document there are two text files provided with this
   package that may be of interest:
 
      dscriptn.txt   contains a description of the directory structure
                     and contents of the SPICE TOOLKIT package.
 
      whats.new      describes new features available in this version
                     of the SPICE TOOLKIT package.
 
 
System Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Before you begin importing the SPICE TOOLKIT package, you should make
   sure that you have approximately 150 Megabytes of free diskspace. After
   the toolkit has been imported you can delete the file toolkit.tar to
   free up approximately a half of space used during the installation.
 
 
Time for Importing.
 
   The amount of time required to perform the import varies, but importing
   typically takes a few minutes.
 
 
If you already have a SPICE TOOLKIT Package
 
   You should backup and move (or remove) any previous editions of the
   SPICE TOOLKIT Package from the directory where you plan to import this
   toolkit. Otherwise this toolkit may be merged with the previous edition
   leading to unpredictable results.
 
 
Importing the SPICE Package
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   You should move the following files to the directory where you want to
   import the SPICE TOOLKIT Package.
 
      toolkit.tar.Z
      importSpice.csh
 
   (Note: If you are copying the ".tar.Z" file via ftp you should copy it
   in "binary" mode. Use "ascii" mode to copy the ".csh" file.)
 
   Now type the following command.
 
      /bin/csh -f importSpice.csh
 
   The script importSpice.csh will uncompress and untar the toolkit and, on
   platforms where NAIF anticipates that it is necessary, compile and link
   all source code products.
 
   If you experience problems with the import process, first refer to the
   section at the end of this document entitled "Importing Problems". If
   you can't resolve the import problem there, contact NAIF for assistance.
 
 
Toolkit Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The Toolkit contains two styles of documentation: a plain text version
   and a hyperlinked html version. NAIF recommends you use the html version
   because of the convenience of the hyperlinking. To do that load the top
   level index of the html documentation -- toolkit/doc/html/index.html --
   into a web browser.
 
 
Recompiling the Toolkit
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   All libraries and executable programs in this package have been
   pre-compiled and build for your convenience. Usually it is not necessary
   to recompile them after you have imported the Toolkit -- you can link to
   the libraries and run the executables ``as is''. In some cases though,
   for example if you are using an earlier version of the same compiler
   and/or operating system, it may be necessary to re-build the Toolkit. To
   recompile all libraries and programs provided in this package, change to
   the top level directory and run the ``makeall.csh'' script as follows:
 
      /bin/csh -f makeall.csh
 
   If you experience problems performing this operation, contact NAIF for
   further assistance.
 
   This package has been pre-compiled on a PC with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
   running Red Hat Enterprise 5.0 Linux using gfortran Fortran compiler
   version 4.3.3 in 32-bit mode.

Importing Problems
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Although the import script does not make a lot of assumptions about your
   computing environment, it must make a few. Importing problems usually
   occur because one of these assumptions is not met by the system where
   the SPICE package is being imported.
 
 
Shell Prompt
 
   In several examples below, we will talk about interacting with the LINUX
   shell. We shall assume that the shell prompts you for input by
   displaying the string:
 
      myprompt>
 
   What your system displays will almost certainly be different.
 
 
LINUX SHELL
 
   It is assumed that you have the C-shell installed on your machine and
   that it is the normal shell you use when working on your system. It is
   easy to determine if this is in fact the case. At the shell prompt type:
 
      myprompt> echo $shell
 
   If you are using the C-shell, you should see the following message on
   your screen.
 
      /bin/csh
 
   If your process responds with some other message, then either you are
   not using the C-shell, or its not in the expected location. To see if
   you have the C-shell available on your system type the following
   command.
 
      myprompt> ls -1 /bin/csh
 
   You should get the following response from your process.
 
      /bin/csh*
 
   If you don't get this, your system doesn't satisfy the import script
   assumptions. You can't import the SPICE package using these
   instructions.
 
 
uncompress and tar
 
   The SPICE package is delivered via a compressed "tar" file. You must
   have the "uncompress" and "tar" program present on your system to import
   the toolkit. You can find out if you have these programs by typing:
 
      mypropmt> which uncompress
      myprompt> which tar
 
   Your system should respond with messages similar to the following
 
      /usr/bin/uncompress
      /bin/tar
 
   If it doesn't you won't be able to extract the toolkit from the "tar"
   file.
 
 
FORTRAN
 
   It is assumed that you have a working FORTRAN compiler and that your
   environment is set up so that you can simply type "gfortran" to invoke
   the compiler. Moreover, it is assumed that "gfortran" is not an alias.
   You can determine whether or not "gfortran" is an alias for some other
   command by typing:
 
      myprompt> alias gfortran
 
   If gfortran is an not an alias, the shell responds by re-issuing the
   shell prompt. In this case you've passed the last hurdle and you should
   be ready to import the SPICE package.
 
   If "gfortran" is an alias, how "gfortran" is aliased will be displayed.
   In this case you need to perform the following two commands.
 
      myprompt> unalias gfortran
      myprompt> which gfortran
 
   The second command should yield a fully qualified path for your FORTRAN
   compiler. If it doesn't you need to find out which directory contains
   the FORTRAN compiler and add this directory to your path.
