PDS Legacy Tools Release Notes
July 2008 Release

This is intended to be an overview of changes/fixes made in the
legacy tools since the last release. For more details, please see
the tools' release notes.

The following JIRA issue has been resolved in the lablib3 library:

PDSEN-131 - OdlPrintLabel routine was fixed to comply with the PDS 
 standards, where each line is no more than 80 characters long and each
 line is terminated with <CR><LF>.


NASAView has been separated from the Tools Package. It is available
as its own downloadable package.

The OAL and LABLIB3 source code, along with a makefile for building the
library, is now included with the Mac distribution of the Tools Package.
