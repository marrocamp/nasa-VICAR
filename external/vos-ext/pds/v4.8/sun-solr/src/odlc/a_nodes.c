  Description: This file contains C routines that create and manipulate
               aggregate nodes on an ODL tree.
 
  Author:  Randy Davis, University of Colorado LASP
 
  Creation Date:  30 August 1990
  Last Modified:  18 May 1991

  History:

    Creation - This set of routines was introduced in Version 2.0 of the
    ODLC library, replacing the similar set of routines available in
    Version 1 for manipulating object nodes.
      a) The routines NewAggregate, RemoveAggregate, FindAggregate,
         NextAggregate and ParentAggregate replace the routines NewObject,
         RemoveObject, FindObject, NextObject and ParentObject that were
         part of Version 1 of the ODLC library.
      b) The function performed by the Version 1 routine NewODLTree
         has been folded into routine NewAggregate.
      c) New routines FindNextAggregate, CopyAggregate, CutAggregate and
         PasteAggregate have been added to provide services useful for
         label editors and similar programs.

    Version 2.1 - 13 March 1991 - Randy Davis, U. of Colorado LASP
      a) Updated routines for cutting, copying and pasting aggregate nodes
         and modified some of the existing routines to take advantage of
         them.
      b) Added handling for the comment and application-specific fields
         that were added to aggregate nodes in Version 2.1.
      c) Added routine NextSubAggregate to improve navigation capabilities.

  Version 2.2 - 18 May 1991 - M. DeMore, Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    Removed include statements that were Unix specific and placed them
    in odldef.h.

  Version 2.3 - 28 August 1992 - M. DeMore, Jet Propulsion Laboratory
   Added handling of SFDU structures for use with PDS toolbox.

  Routine: NewAggregate
 
  Description: Inserts a new aggregate node into an ODL tree.                 
 
  Input:
          base_node   - A pointer to the node that will become the parent
                        of the new aggregate we are creating.  If this pointer
                        is NULL, then the new node will be a root node for
                        a new ODL tree.
          kind        - Kind of node: object (KA_OBJECT) or group (KA_GROUP).
          name        - Pointer to a character string containing the new
                        node's name.  A non-null name must be provided.
          pds_class       - If the new aggregate node is an object node, this
                        character string contains the object's pds_class.  It
                        may be NULL or a null string ("") if the pds_class in
                        not specified. This argument is ignored for group
                        nodes.
 
  Output: A pointer to the new aggregate node is returned as the function
          value. A value of NULL indicates that the new node could not be
          created, probably due to a lack of dynamic memory.  A NULL value
          will also be returned if the name argument is NULL.

  Routine: NextAggregate
 
  Description: Returns the aggregate node after the one pointed to by the

               traversal of the tree.  Basically the scheme is as follows:
                 1) If the base node has children then its first child
                    is returned.
                 2) If a node has no children and is not the last child
                    of its parent, then the sibling to the immediate
                    right is returned.
                 3) Otherwise move to the node's parent and go back to
                    step 2.
                 4) If there is no next node then the value NULL will
                    be returned.
 
  Input:
          base_node  - A pointer to the starting aggregate node.
 
  Output: A pointer to the next node is returned as the function value.
          A NULL value indicates that there is no next node.  The NULL
          value is also returned if the input argument is NULL.

/*****************************************************************************

  Routine: PasteAggregate
 
  Description: Attach an aggregate node (along with its parameters and
               all of its progeny aggregate nodes) to the specified
               aggregate node.
 
  Input:
          base_node - A pointer to the node that will become the parent
                      to the inserted node.
   
          aggregate - A pointer to the aggregrate node to be attached.
 
  Output: A pointer to the attached aggregate node is returned as the
          function value.  If either of the input arguments is NULL,
          the NULL value will be returned.
