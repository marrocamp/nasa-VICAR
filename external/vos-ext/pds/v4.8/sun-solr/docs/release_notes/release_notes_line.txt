Software Overview
=================
     
  The user selects one or more files to be processed.  The LINE
  program analyzes each line in each file and reports on the status
  of certain PDS standards and the value associated with some of
  the PDS keywords:
     
          use of line terminator
          illegal ASCII characters
          RECORD TYPE keyword
          INTERCHANGE FORMAT keyword
          ROWS keyword
          RECORD BYTES keyword
          ROW BYTES keyword
     
  From the report, the user is able to discern the physical
  characteristics of each file, and compare these against the
  expected characteristics.  For example, a TEXT file should
  have line terminators for every line in the file,
  no illegal characters such as TAB, etc.).
