PDS Validation Tools

===========================================================================

Version 4.1 March 2006

tkvalid.pl
----------
Added an option to disable the aliasing feature for the label validation
test. Default is to enable the aliasing feature.

validate.pl
-----------
Add a new flag, --nalias, to disable aliasing when running the label
validation test.

Users guide for the PVT has been updated to reflect the latest options
that are available in the tools.

===========================================================================

Version 4.0 July 2005

Added a Software DISCLAIMER message to the aareadme.txt file
    
validate.pl
----------
Made this script to run in batch mode again by default. Pop-up windows that
used to appear by default now need to be set if the user wants to enable
these windows to show:

-rw   Display the output report window
-s    Display the "Summary of Messages Found" window

Script also runs the label validation test with the option "only validate
level 3 labels" ON by default. User can turn this OFF by setting "--nol3d"
on the command-line.

Added a new option, --se, that saves the temporary files that the label
validation test creates when it encounters a STRUCTURE pointer in a label
file. This temporary file is saved onto the users hard drive so that the
user can refer to this file when it goes through the output report and
finds error messages that point to this temporary files.

tkvalid.pl has been modified accordingly to account for these changes.

Also, validate.pl, tkvalid.pl, checkiso.pl, and listerr.pl have been
modified to capture directory name inputs with spaces properly
(i.e. C:\Documents and Settings\...)  

bin directory has been removed from the tree structure. Instead, kwvtool, 
lvtool, make_index, and isochecker reside in the same directory as the
scripts.

===========================================================================

Version 3.0 September 2004

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

It is recommended that the user creates their own pdsdd.idx file under
the pvt\data directory. There have been pointer issues in the past that
resulted in the pdsdd.idx file not being found when running the PERL
ools.
    
Run the PDS tool called "make_index" on the pdsdd.full file found in
the pvt\data directory before using any of the PERL tools.

Changes for this version:

Made changes in tkvalid.pl, validate.pl, and listerr.pl to allow a user to
once again run in batch mode processing without interruption of pop-up
windows that would appear after the label valdition test is complete. Many
additional command-line options have been added to these scripts. Please
see the PVT users guide under the docs directory to see a detailed
description of all the command-line options available to these 3 script
files.
    
===========================================================================

Version 2.0 March 2004

Changes for this version:

    Updated message_list.txt to include more error and warning messages.

    The "Label Validation Settings" screen had its 2 buttons renamed to 
    "Run Tests" and "Back to Main Menu."

    Most of the perl scripts had a mixture of '/' with '\' when stating 
    file names that contain a directory path. They've been changed to
    become consistent.  

New features:

Once the Label Validation Test is finished, a new screen will appear that
allows a user to select which messages to see associated file names for. 
See aareadme.txt for detailed information on how to use this new feature.
   
A list of what options were chosen for the Label Validation Test can now be
found at the top of the final report. Also, the final report now contains
summaries of each message generated during the Validation Test. The summary
information consists of how many times and in how many files each message
occurred.

An output window will now appear after the PVT finishes running its tests.
This window was created so that a user will not need to bring up a text
editor in order to see the results of the tests they chose to run. A copy
of this report is still saved on file. 

===========================================================================

Version 1.0 June 2003

New to version 1.0 is the ability of the user to select what types of 
messages they do not want to see in the report when running the label
validation test.

Isochecker program has been fixed to correctly work on Solaris and Linux
systems.

listerr.pl now also lists warning and informational messages found in the 
lvtool report file.

checklab.pl has been removed as one of the test item selections in
tkvalid.pl. Lvtool already performs a more efficient check than
checklab.pl, so this script was able to go away.

For a detailed description on how to run the new features of the validation
tools, please see the aareadme.txt file.

 
KNOWN BUGS:

Entering an incorrect path to the cd device for linux or solaris may cause 
the program to "freeze" unexpectedly.
