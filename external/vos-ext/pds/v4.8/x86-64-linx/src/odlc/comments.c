  Description: Routines for attaching comments to aggregate and parameter
               nodes on an ODL tree and for removing such comments.

  History:

    Creation - This set of routines was introduced in Version 2.1 of the
    ODLC library.

  Version 2.2 - 18 May 1991 - M. DeMore, Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    Removed include statements that were Unix specific and placed them
    in odldef.h.

  Routine: CommentAggregate
 
  Description: Attach a comment to or detach one from an aggregate node.
               The previous comment, if any, is discarded.
 
  Input:
          aggregate - Pointer to the aggregate node.
          comment   - Character string with comment to be attached. If
                      this argument is NULL, then the aggregate node
                      will have no comment.
 
  Output: A value of 1 is returned as the function value if processing
          is successful.  If the operation fails, typically due to a
          lack of memory in which to store the comment, a value of 0
          is returned.  A value of 0 will also be returned if the
          input base node argument is NULL.

  Routine: CommentParameter
 
  Description: Attach a comment to or detach one from a parameter node.
               The previous comment, if any, is discarded.
 
  Input:
          parameter - Pointer to the parameter node.
          comment   - Character string with comment to be attached. If
                      this argument is NULL, then the parameter node
                      will have no comment.
 
  Output: A value of 1 is returned as the function value if processing
          is successful.  If the operation fails, typically due to a
