LABLIB LIBRARY RELEASE NOTES

=============================================================================
VERSION 2.10   June 2007

Re-compiled due to changes in the ODLC library

=============================================================================
VERSION 2.9    March 2006

Made minor fix to not print out the severity level twice when displaying 
messages onto the user's screen when running LVTOOL.


=================================================================================
VERSION 2.8    July 2005

Delete scratch files from memory if it cannot be written to in the first place.

Change made to allow the ODL library to write the scratch files onto the current
working directory in Windows instead of the C drive. This was due to cases where
a user would not have write permissions onto the C drive.

Made a change in lablib to de-allocate the temp filenames created when a "scratch"
file (temp file) is not able to be created. This prevents tools from breaking on
machines where users don't have have write access to a hard drive.


=================================================================================

VERSION 2.7    SEPTEMBER 10, 2004

This library has been re-compiled, but no changes were made


=================================================================================

VERSION 2.7    MARCH 2004

Minor fix to errorlib.c to clear out a string containing the severity level 
of each message when going through a message list. This prevents carrying
over the severity from one message to the next by accident.

Modified labutil.c and labutil.h to add the units of a value to the end of the
string
