ODLC Version 2.11   June 2007

Parser fixes, which include:

- Properly handling 2-Dimensional sequences

- 'Gracefully' handling a malformed number in exponential format
  (Example: 1E+30)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ODLC Version 2.10   March 2006

Increased the PDS_ELEMENT_LEN value from 60 to 61 to take into account the
colon found in a local data dictionary keyword.

A change was made to ODL when it converts a string to an integer. If an
overflow occurs in the process, the message that will be printed out will
tell the user exactly what value the keyword was set to.

i.e. Before we had something like,

1WARNING: Line 46 -- Magnitude of integer number is too large.  The
2                    number has been set to the maximum positive value.


Now, we have a more detailed description,

1WARNING: Line 46 -- Magnitude of integer number is too large.  The
2                    number has been set to the maximum positive value of
3                    2147483647.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ODLC Version 2.9 July 2005

Change made to prevent crash in creating an expanded label file when the 
original label contains 70 or more consecutive characters.

Also made change so that when tabs and newlines are encountered in a label file,
the new label file being written will correctly indicate that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ODLC Version 2.8 March 2005

Change made to allow keyword values of NULL_CONSTANT = 0000-00 or 0000-00-00

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ODLC Version 2.7 September 10, 2004

This has been re-compiled, but no new changes have been made

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ODLC Version 2.7 March 2004

Changes made to the parser to allow it to grab a unit ID value even if a 
keyword value is "NULL". 
i.e. KEYWORD = "NULL" <km>

Changed PDS_ELEMENT_LEN, located in pdsdef.h, from 30 to 60

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ODLC Version 2.6 June 2003
