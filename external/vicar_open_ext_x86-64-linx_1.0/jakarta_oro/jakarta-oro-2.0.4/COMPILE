The Jakarta-ORO library follows the same build procedure as other
Jakarta projects, relying on the Ant build system.  You can learn more
about the Ant build system from http://jakarta.apache.org/.  However,
building the Jakarta-ORO library does not require any knowledge of
Ant.  A Unix build script and a Win32 batch file are provided in the
build/ directory.  These scripts take care of invoking Ant for you.
By default they will build a jar file containing the library.
Optionally, you can pass one of the following build targets as an
argument to the script:
	 lib	      - builds the library
	 examples     - builds the example programs
	 examples-awk - builds the org.apache.oro.text.awk examples
	 tools        - builds the utility programs
	 jar          - builds a jar file containing the class library
	 javadocs     - builds the API documentation
	 package      - builds a source distribution package
	 package-zip  - builds a distribution package stored as a zip file
	 package-tgz  - builds a distribution package stored as a
			gzipped tar file (.tar.gz)
	 clean        - removes all files generated by build targets

All generated class files are stored a classes/ directory.  All
documentation is stored in a doc/ directory.

To execute any of the build targets, your current working directory
should be the build directory.  Change to the directory first before
executing the build scripts.

Examples:
	To build only the library use:

	   build.sh lib

	To build only the javadocs use:

	   build.sh javadocs
