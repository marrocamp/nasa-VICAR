Creating KWVTOOL requires include files that are supplied as part of
lvtool, odlc, and lablib.  It will also require object modules created from
files that are supplied with lvtool.  It will need the odlc library and the
lablib(not lablib3) library.

Software Description
--------------------

This tool is useful to the data engineers for locating the unique
set of values associated with each keyword in an archive product.
The user selects one or more files for processing.  The KWVTOOL
program scans each file and creates a report of each keyword used
and the set of values associated with each keyword.

===========================================================================
KWVTOOL 2.4    June 2007

Changed to not create a scratch file in a Windows environment. There is no
need for it.

===========================================================================
KWVTOOL 2.3    March 2006

Due to changes in the ODLC library, KWVTOOL can now properly handle local
keywords that can potentially be 61 characters long.

===========================================================================
KWVTOOL 2.2    October 2005


KWVTOOL now gives the user the option to input either the pdsdd.idx file or
the pdsdd.full file. If the full file is desired, you will need to use the
-df option instead of the -d option like so,

kwvtool -df c:\data\pdsdd.full

KWVTOOL uses the MAKE INDEX program (version 1.7 or higher) to create the
data dictionary index file in this case. Because of this dependency, you
must make sure that the MAKE INDEX program is in the same directory as the
KWVTOOL program or that the PATH environment is set properly to where the
MAKE INDEX program can be located.

Added a software disclaimer message to the usage screen

Fixed a bug to prevent program crash when a keyword value is longer than
250 characters

Fixed a bug where KWVTOOL would crash when checking a file against a
directory the user wants to exclude from processing

Made a bug fix to KWVTOOL. When KWVTOOL checks for duplicate keywords, it
would not write out to the report file when it had exactly 2 keywords to
check from.

===========================================================================
KWVTOOL 2.1    March 2005

Re-compiled due to change in ODL library

KWVTOOL will now create the data dictionary index file internally. 
Historically, the user would need to specify the data dictionary index file
on the command-line. Now, the user must input the data dictionary full file. 

i.e. kwvtool -d c:\data\pdsdd.full ...

The data dictionary index file is deleted from the user's system upon
completion of program.

IMPORTANT NOTE
KWVTOOL uses the MAKE INDEX program to create the data dictionary index
file. Because of this, the user must make sure that the MAKE INDEX program
is in the same directory as the KWVTOOL program or that the PATH
environment is set properly to where the MAKE INDEX program is located. 


Additional Changes:

Modified output report to indent once it starts reporting keywords that 
are/are not in the data dictionary. Originally, it was in this format, but
was changed in version 2.0, which broke the PDS PERL Tools. 


===========================================================================

KWVTOOL 2.0    September 10, 2004

New Capability added:

KWVTOOL defaults to checking a file for the existence of a label before 
validating it. User can turn off this feature by specifying "-nol3d" on
the command line. 

Removed the following command line options: -t, -nt, -p, -np, -v, -nv.

===========================================================================

KWVTOOL 1.9

New feature that displays a unit ID value in the report.
         
Properly handles local data dictionary keywords that are greater than
30 characters long
         
Fixed program to correctly exclude directories to skip if that option
is set.
         
Program now removes "JunkZZZxx" files after execution.
         
Updated usage description of "-ivd" in the help of this program.
         
Made code more robust in its checking of directories to exclude.

===========================================================================
         
KWVTOOL 1.8 June 2003
	  Changes for this version:
	     This is a recompile due to changes in ODLC.

===========================================================================
