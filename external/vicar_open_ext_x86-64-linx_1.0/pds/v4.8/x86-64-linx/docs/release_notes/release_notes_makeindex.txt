MAKE INDEX USAGE NOTE

The Windows version of Make_Index uses a scratch file.  By default the
file is placed in the root directory of drive C. Several users have
pointed out that they do not have write privileges on C. The scratch file
is actually made by LABLIB.  Before making the scratch file LABLIB looks
in the working directory for a file named "pdstool.set".  If this file
contains the keyword SCRATCH_DIR and an = sign followed by the path of
a directory in which the user has rights then the scratch file will be
created in that directory.  If there is no pdstool.set file, or if the
file does not have the SCRATCH_DIR keyword then the file will be
placed in the root directory of C.
 
Here is a sample line that shows the correct use of the SCRATCH_DIR
keyword:

SCRATCH_DIR = d:\pdstool_box\make_index

Version 1.10   June 2007

Fix:

Properly handle quoted object names found in the pdsdd.full.
(example: NAME = "MRO:ACTIVITY_ID")

==========================================================================
Version 1.9    March 2006

Due to changes in the ODLC and LABLIB libraries, MAKE_INDEX can now
handle local data dictionary keywords that could potentially be 61
characters long.

===============================================================================
make_index 1.8   July 2005

Added software disclaimer message to the usage screen

===============================================================================
make_index 1.7   March 2005

Modified the program to return a 0 upon successful creation of the data 
dictionary index file and completion of the program. Otherwise, MAKE INDEX
will return a non-0 value (1 in this case) if there were problems.

make_index 1.6   September 10, 2004

This has been re-compiled, but no new changes have been made

===============================================================================

make_index 1.6   March 2004
          Changes for this version
              This is a recompile due to changes in ODLC

              RECORD_BYTES length has been increased from 80 to 120 bytes
              in the resulting indexed version of the data dictionary. This
              allows local data dictionary keywords whose length is greater
              than 30 characters long to be handled properly.

make_index 1.5
	  Changes for this version
	      This is a recompile due to changes in ODLC

================================================================================		

make_index 1.4
 

          make_Index is the routine that is run against the PDS Data
          Dictionary (pdsdd.full) to create an indexed version (pdsdd.idx).
          This indexed version of the data dictionary is used by lvtool and
          a number of other PDS Toolbox tools.

This version handles GROUPS
