DDICT uses include files that are part of lvtool, odlc, and lablib.  It
will also expect to compile a number of object modules from files that are
supplied with lvtool. It will need the odlc library and the lablib
(not lablib3) library.

===========================================================================
VERSION 4.7   June 2007

Changed to not create a scratch file in a Windows environment. There is no
need for it.

===========================================================================

VERSION 4.6   March 2006

Re-compiled due to changes in the ODLC and LABLIB libraries, but no new
changes have been made to DDICT itself.

===========================================================================

VERSION 4.5   July 2005

DDICT now gives the user the option to input either the pdsdd.idx file or
the pdsdd.full file. If the full file is desired, you will need to use the
-df option instead of the -d option like so,

ddict -df c:\data\pdsdd.full

DDICT uses the MAKE INDEX program (version 1.7 or higher) to create the
data dictionary index file in this case. Because of this dependency, you
must make sure that the MAKE INDEX program is in the same directory as the
DDICT program or that the PATH environment is set properly to where the
MAKE INDEX program can be located.

Added a software disclaimer message to the usage screen
                    
Fixed a bug to prevent program crash when a keyword value is longer than
250 characters

===========================================================================

VERSION 4.4   March 2005

Re-compiled due to change in the ODL Library

DDICT will now create the data dictionary index file internally. 
Historically, the user would need to specify the data dictionary index file
on the command-line. Now, the user must input the data dictionary full file. 

i.e. ddict -d c:\data\pdsdd.full ...

The data dictionary index file is deleted from the user's system upon
completion of program.

IMPORTANT NOTE
DDICT uses the MAKE INDEX program to create the data dictionary index file. 
Because of this, the user must make sure that the MAKE INDEX program is
in the same directory as the DDICT program or that the PATH environment is
set properly to where the MAKE INDEX program is located. 

===========================================================================

VERSION 4.3   September 10, 2004

DDICT will now check for the existence of a label in a file before
validation. User can turn this option off by specifying the "-nol3d"
option on the command line.

Removed "-v" option, which placed the tool in verbose mode. This will
become default.

Removed the following additional options: "-t", "-nt", "-p", "-np", "-nd"

Added the following command-line options:
  * -lef: Specify a file for logging file names that were skipped during
          processing
  * -ivf: Specify a file containing file extensions to skip. One extension
          per line is allowed, and only 50 extensions maximum can be
          specified
  
  * -sf:  Specifies a file containing keywords to be skipped during
          processing. Keywords are comma separated, no blanks, case
          sensitive, and only 200 characters long for the whole file itself
          is allowed.
          
Capability has been added to no longer continue processing without a data
dictionary

===========================================================================

VERSION 4.2
      
Properly handles local data dictionary keywords that are greater than
30 characters long

Fixes to a routine in ddict to correctly generate the list of file
extensions to exclude if the user specified that option in the command
line.
        
DDICT will now remove the "JunkZZZ" files it creates during program
execution.

===========================================================================

Version 4.1 Release, June 2003
	  Changes for this release
                recompile due to changes in ODLC

===========================================================================
DDICT 4.0  

Program now recognizes GROUPs
	  	   
Run the program without any input parameters to see paremeter list

The user selects one or more files for processing.  The DDICT
program searches each file and reports on the unique set of PDS
keywords used within the user selected files.  The report file
lists each PDS keyword and the respective PDS definition.
     
The report file is useful for the data producers to include the
PDS keyword definitions onto an archive product.  This will allow
someone in 50 years to understand each PDS keyword.
