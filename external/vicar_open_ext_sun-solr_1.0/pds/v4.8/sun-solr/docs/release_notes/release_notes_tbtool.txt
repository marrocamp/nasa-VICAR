TBTool Release Notes

===========================================================================
Version 1.8      June 2007

Re-compiled due to changes in the ODLC library, but no modifications have
been made to the tool itself.

WARNING: It is recommended that only one label file be opened at a time per
         program execution if you are running tbtool on Solaris. There is
         an 'f' command in tbtool that allows you to open another label file
         while tbtool is still running. However, on Solaris machines, it
         will crash if it opens certain label files because of memory
         handling issues. This DOES NOT occur on Windows and LINUX.

===========================================================================
Version 1.7      March 2006

This has been re-compiled due to changes in the ODLC and LABLIB libraries,

Version 1.3      03-06-03

Version 1.3 of tbtool contains enhancements and bug fixes from version 1.2
such as:

New functionality to browse through containers in a label file with the use
of the "K" command. Typing in "K" at the user prompt will enable tbtool to
find and display the first column in the first container. Typing in a
number in front  of or after the "K" command will display the
user-specified container and display the first column in that container.
So, for example, if the user types in "3K" or "K3", tbtool will locate and
display the 3rd container in the file. Additional commands include, "NK"
for browsing to the next container and "PK" for browsing to the previous
container. 
  
Removed "missing SFDU" messages

Fixed bugs in tbtool to correctly handle and display nested, multiple
containers. 

When displaying a column inside a container, the container name will be
displayed on the screen as well to make the user aware of what container
they are looking in.

Version 1.2	 10-24-02
Dale Schultz	Software Designer
Michael Cayanan/Jet Propulsion Laboratory 

Version 1.2 of Tbtool contains the following features:

New functionality to read containers found in a label file. Functionality
to handle nested containers are in this version as well, however that
feature has not been tested due to lack of existing labels with nested
containers. The table information now displays how many containers are
found in a label file. The column information now shows whether or not the
column is within a container. When displaying column values within a
container, tbtool will display the repetition number and column number of
that column within the container.

New functionality to handle 6-byte MSB_UNSIGNED, LSB_UNSIGNED, MSB_SIGNED,
and LSB_SIGNED integers.

Version 1.1	09-13-2002
Dale Schultz	Software Designer

This is the first official release version of tbtool. This new version contains the following updates:

-For more information on the various tbtool commands, type in "help" after running tbtool.

-Bug fixes. Will warn the user of potential "bad" values being read from a label instead of just 
 crashing like the previous version of tbtool. (The previous version kept crashing when a real number was too 
 high for the variable to hold. You might want to verify that the label file is correct.) 
 
-New functionality that allows the user to specify an integer in front of or after the "up" or "down"
 command so that the program can jump that many rows up or down. This funcionality is stated in the help in 
 tbtool, but was never actually implemented.
 i.e. if "50D" or "D50" is entered, the program will move down 50 rows from the current point in the row
      and start displaying the data from that point on. For example, if the first row being displayed is 30 and
      you enter the command "100D" or "D100", the program will display the rows starting from row 130. 

-New functionality to handle 8-byte MSB_UNSIGNED, LSB_UNSIGNED, MSB SIGNED, and LSB SIGNED integers.

-For a detailed description on the various commands found in tbtool, type in "help" after running tbtool.

-This release is operational on Windows, Solaris, and LINUX O/S systems. 
 WARNING: It is recommended that only one label file be opened at a time per program execution if you are running 
 	  tbtool on Solaris. There is an "f" command in tbtool that allows you to open another label file while 
 	  tbtool is still running. However, on Solaris machines, it will crash if it opens certain label files 
 	  because of memory handling issues. This DOES NOT occur on Windows and LINUX.

If compiling on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studios, the macros you must specify for the compiler under 
properties are "MSDOS_TC" and "PDS_TOOLBOX".


 check that your label is correct and up to PDS Standards.
