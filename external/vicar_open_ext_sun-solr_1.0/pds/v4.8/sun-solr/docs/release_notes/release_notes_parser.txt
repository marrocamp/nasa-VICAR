Parse Label File Program

This software is a Java application that checks PDS label files against a
grammer. The grammer uses the ANTLR Tools to check the file structure for
compliance with standards established by the PDS.

*** RUNNING PARSE FILE PROGRAM ***
The command line format for running the Parse File Program is:

java -jar parser.jar <label file> (-showTree) (-writeXML <filename>)
    (-writeMergedSrc <filename>)

The -showTree option displays the ANTLR AST tree in GUI window. 

The -writeXML <filename> option will write the XML file which 
     was converted from the Label File.  

The -writeMergedSrc <filename> option will write out the Label File
     with its STRUCTURE and DESCRIPTION files included if found.
