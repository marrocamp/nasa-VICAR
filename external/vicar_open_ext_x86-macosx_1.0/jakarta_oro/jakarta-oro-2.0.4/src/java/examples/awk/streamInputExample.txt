Many programmers believe C++ is too complicated for its own good and prefer
to avoid its more obscure and confusing features.  In fact, some programmers
are so fed up with the language that they will only program in Java, even
though Java is still very immature and dog-slow.  That is not to say that
Java is necessarily a better language than C++, but rather that Java simply
has a stronger appeal to the tired C++ programmer.


C++ is an object-oriented descendent of C.  Being derived from C gave it
one marvelous feature that Java lacks: the C preprocessor.  C++ programmers
that have converted to Java are banging their heads against their keyboards
because they do not have a true conditional compilation mechanism.  Of
course, the lack of enumerations is also a great pain, although tolerable to
some.
