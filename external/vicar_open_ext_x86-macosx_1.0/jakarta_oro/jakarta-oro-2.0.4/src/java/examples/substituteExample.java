  /**
   * A good way for you to understand the substitute() method is to play around
   * with it by using this test program.  The program takes 3 to 5 arguments
   * as follows:
   *   java substituteExample
   *     regex substitution input [sub limit] [interpolation limit]
   * regex - A regular expression used to find parts of the input to be
   *         substituted.
   * sub limit - An optional argument limiting the number of substitutions.
   *             If no limit is given, the limit used is Util.SUBSTITUTE_ALL.
   * input - A string to be used as input for substitute().
   * interpolation limit - An optional argument limiting the number of
   *             interpolations performed.
   *
   * Try the following command line for a simple example of subsitute().
   * It changes (2,3) to (3,2) in the input.
   *          java substituteExample '\(2,3\)' '(3, 2)' '(1,2) (2,3) (4,5)'
   *
   * The following command line shows the substitute limit at work.  It
   * changed the first four 1's in the input to 4's.
   *          java substituteExample '1' '4' '381298175 1111'
   *
   * The next command line shows how to use interpolations.  Suppose we
   * want to reverse the coordinates of the first 3 entries in the input
   * and then have all the rest of the coordinates be equal to the new 3rd
   * entry:
java substituteExample '\((\d+),(\d+)\)' '($2,$1)' '(1,2) (2,3) (4,5) (8,8) (9,2)' 5 3
